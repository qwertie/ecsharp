<h1>The One Nonterminal Expression Parser (ONEP)</h1>




<h2>Overview</h2>

ONEP, represented by the IOneParser&lt;Expr,Token&gt; interface and the
BasicOneParser&lt;Expr,Token&gt; class, is an ad-hoc expression parsing
system designed for Loyc. The core
components and design elements of Loyc are specially crafted to fit
together, so you can't really understand why ONEP is designed the way
it is&nbsp;unless you understand how it fits together with
Loyc.&nbsp;Nevertheless,&nbsp;BasicOneParser is designed to be generic
so it can be used in a variety of ways, independently of Loyc.<br>




<br>




Most parsing systems are more general than Loyc's. They are concerned
with "languages" and "grammars", whereas Loyc deals with the more
specific concepts of "statements" and "expressions". Most parsers parse
statements and expressions and other things with a single grammar,
whereas Loyc completely separates expression parsing from statement
parsing. It also performs "tree parsing" (collapsing stuff between
brackets into single tokens), which allows additional flexibility&nbsp;during expression parsing as I will explain later.<br>




<br>




So given that tree parsing and statement parsing are (generally) done
before expression parsing, we can parse expressions with the
assumptions that<br>




<ol>




  <li>The boundaries (beginning and end) of an expression are
known before parsing starts.</li>




  <li>Bracket groups are detected before parsing starts.</li>




</ol>




To parse expressions, it helps to know what an expression "is" and how
it differs from other programming-language constructs such as tokens,
statements, etc. First of all, an expression is most easily understood
as something derived from a list of tokens, rather than a list of
characters. (just to&nbsp;be clear: Loyc derives expressions from tokens, not raw characters.)<br>




<br>




In a programming language, an expression is usually something that has
a data type and a value. For example, 2+3 is an expression whose data
type is Int32 (in .NET) and whose value is 5. However, this is a
semantic conception of expressions, and since ONEP is a parser it
doesn't care whether expressions have data types and values. In fact,
ONEP may be used for expressions that do not have types or values. For
example EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) is an language for expressing
syntax; here is the syntax for a "number":<br>




<pre><code>number : '-'? D+ ('.' D+)?<br>D : '0'|'1'|'2'|'3'|'4'|'5'|'6'|'7'|'8'|'9'</code></pre>




Note: I'm not going to explain EBNF
or&nbsp;the&nbsp;terminology of grammars--try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar">Wikipedia</a>
or <a href="http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/text/bnf.html">this
page</a>.<br>




<br>




We could imagine that EBNF expressions have a "data type" and "values",
but that would be missing the point. EBNF expresses syntax, not types
or values or computation. Yet ONEP can&nbsp;parse it&nbsp;just
the same.<br>




<br>




When I tried to define expressions from a purely&nbsp;syntactic
perspective, this is what I came up with:<br>




<br>




<div style="margin-left: 40px;">An expression language is
a language
that can be expressed using only a single nonterminal and an arbitrary
set of disambiguation rules.</div>




<br>




Note:&nbsp;when I say "one nonterminal" I mean to exclude EBNF
features
(?, *, +) that&nbsp;require multiple nonterminals when expressed
in&nbsp;BNF.<br>




<br>




For example, a simple numeric expression language might be represented
by<br>




<pre>expr : NUMBER<br>     | IDENTIFIER<br>     | expr '+' expr<br>     | expr '-' expr<br>     | expr '/' expr<br>     | expr '*' expr<br>     | '-' expr<br>     | '(' expr ')'<br></pre>




If this were all, ambiguous expressions would be easy to construct:
does 2+3*4 mean (2+3)*4 or 2+(3*4)? Thus, if we are to use only one
nonterminal, some&nbsp;rules are needed to decide which
interpretation
is correct. For example, if we say that the '*' and '/' productions
have higher <span style="font-style: italic;">precedence</span>
than
the ones with '-' and '+', and that otherwise they have
left-associativity, I think that's enough to make ambiguous expressions
impossible here.<br>




<br>




It is upon this conception of expressions that I have designed ONEP. I
don't have a PhD in anything, let alone language parsing; I needed the
one nonterminal limitation to simplify the problem enough for me to
solve.<br>




<br>




ONEP is designed for the following situation:<br>




<ul>




  <li>The set of available operators may not be
known&nbsp;until it
is actually time to start parsing. In addition to Loyc extensions, the
program being compiled may define its own new operators, and some
operators may be limited to specific contexts.</li>




  <li>Operators may come from several sources (extensions) and in
general, authors of different operators are not&nbsp;aware of each
other's existence.</li>




  <li>Hundreds of unique sets of operators&nbsp;may be needed
while compiling&nbsp;a given program.</li>




  <li>Ambiguity shoule be avoided whenever possible through the
use of disambiguation mechanisms such as precedence levels.</li>




  <li>Any remaining ambiguity should be detected and reported so
that the user is aware of conflicts.</li>




  <li>Operators should have no effect if they&nbsp;are not
available in a given expression.</li>




  <li>Operator tokens do not usually have a distinct token type
because they are not "reserved". A punctuation-based
operator&nbsp;usually has token type PUNC, and a word-based
operator usually has token type ID.&nbsp;Conventional parser
designs require that each operator or special word has its own token
type; a parser without this requirement must be designed differently.</li>




</ul>




I'm telling&nbsp;you up front that my ONEP implementation is not
perfect.
There are some expression interpretations it cannot see,
and&nbsp;certain combinations of operators and input expressions
that
are parsed very&nbsp;slowly. It is my hope that someone else will
invent a better algorithm at some point in the future. Nevertheless, I
hope you'll find that it is fast for common cases and fulfills
the&nbsp;needs of most people.<br>




<h2>Representation of operators</h2>




A single production, together with its precedence rules and associated
code, is called an operator; for example we can sum up the "binary
plus" operator as
<pre>expr '+' expr (precedence 36 on both sides)</pre>




Again, there can be no loops or optional elements in the operator. In
Loyc, associativity is implicitly indicated by the precedence level:
even numbers imply left-associativity; odd numbers imply
right-associativity. This avoids the issue of how operators with the
same precedence but different associativity should interact.
Conventional&nbsp;precedence levels are listed in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Precedence</span>
enumeration; lower numbers signify higher precedence.<br>




<br>




In code, an operator is described by an object implementing <span style="font-weight: bold;">IOneOperator&lt;Expr,Token&gt;</span>.&nbsp;It
supplies&nbsp;the following:<br>




<ul>




  <li>'Parts': this is the most important part. It is an array of
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">OneOperatorPart&lt;Token&gt;</span>
objects, each of which describes a matching token or
subexpression.</li>




  <li>'Name': a user-visible name for the operator, e.g. "binary
+"; this name is used in error and warning messages related to the
operator.&nbsp;Consider this member to be mainly informational.</li>




  <li>'Type': a Type&nbsp;to represent the
operator;&nbsp; More than one "operator" can have the same symbol.
By convention, if the operator produces LoycExpr objects, they are
given the same Type as the operator, although this is not required.
Consider this member to be mainly informational.</li>




</ul>




Informally, the word "operator" may also refer to a group of related&nbsp;operators with&nbsp;similar syntax and the same Type.<br>




<br>

IOneOperator also supplies three methods, ComparePriority(),
IsAcceptable() and Generate().&nbsp;ComparePriority() can resolve
ambiguities
between this operator and another; IsAcceptable() is another resolution
mechanism:&nbsp;IsAcceptable() allows an
operator to reject its own&nbsp;parse if it doesn't like the
arguments and/or tokens that make up the expression. These two methods
allow some special-case behavior. The third method, Generate(), is
called to produce the output expression or value after the ambiguities
(if any) are resolved.<br>




<br>




OneOperatorPart objects can match one of three things:<br>




<ol>




  <li>A literal string such as "+=" or "append".</li>




  <li>A token type&nbsp;such as ID or DQ_STRING</li>




  <li>A sub-expression of a particular precedence. In this
document I use "eN" to refer to an expression of precedence N, for
example e36 (addition/subtraction) or e28 (multiplication/division).</li>




</ol>




Also, if a literal string and a token type are specified, then both the
string and type have to match simultaneously.<br>




<br>




Since precedence is defined on each subexpression, rather than on the
operator as a whole, it is possible to have a different precedence on
each side of a binary operator. This is the most useful when one of the
expressions is supposed to be a type. For example, the C# "as" operator
tries to treat a value as a&nbsp;type specified on the right-hand
side:<br>




<pre>object a = "hello";<br>string b = a as string;<br></pre>




Now suppose we add duck typing to C#. Duck typing, as envisioned in
boo, is really a special kind of object that you can do almost anything
you want with without any complaint from the compiler. For instance if
<span style="font-weight: bold;">d</span> is a duck of unknown type, I can call <span style="font-weight: bold;">d</span>.Explode("24 tons of TNT") and
reflection will be used to look for an <span style="font-weight: bold;">Explode</span> method at run-time. You
should also be able to do this:<br>




<pre>Console.WriteLine(2&nbsp;* 3 as duck * 4); // Print 24</pre>




My testing suggests the actual Microsoft C# compiler couldn't handle
this expression even if there were such a thing as a duck;
apparently&nbsp;it uses the same precedence on the left and right
sides:<br>




<pre>Console.WriteLine((2&nbsp;* 3) as (duck * 4));</pre>




This can only parse correctly if the right-hand side has higher
precedence than the "*" operator:<br>




<pre>Console.WriteLine(((2&nbsp;* 3) as duck) * 4); // Print 24</pre>




Hence, the 'as' operator should perhaps be described by<br>




<pre>e50 'as' e10</pre>




But how precisely does an expression with different precedences on each
side get parsed? I'll explain later. (if I don't, remind me by email.)<br>



<h2>The punctuation&nbsp;problem</h2>


There is an annoying&nbsp;problem with punctuation in Loyc. In most
compilers, the lexer translates punctuation into operator tokens; in
C++, for example, the sequence of punctuation<br>


<br>


%&gt;&gt;+===++=<br>


<br>


is separated out into the tokens<br>


<br>


'%' '&gt;&gt;' '+=' '==' '++' '='.<br>


<br>


but this is not possible in Loyc because the lexer, which is isolated
from other parsing subsystems, doesn't know what operators exist. One
solution would be to require that all operators register themselves
somehow so that the lexer can identify them. However, different
operators may exist in different parts of one source file, and one of
my goals was to prevent operators from affecting code in which they are
not available. If all operators were registered in advance, it would
sometimes happen that an operator can be detected in a place where it's
not available. For example, suppose that at a certain place,&nbsp;unary
and binary '-' operators are available. Then<br>


<pre>a--b</pre>


should be interpreted as<br>


<pre>a - (-b)</pre>


But if the lexer was informed of a "--" operator (which is not
available in this particular expression), the code would be interpreted
as<br>


<pre>a -- b</pre>


which is presumably meaningless.<br>


<br>


In Loyc, contiguous blocks of punctuation are grouped together into
PUNC tokens. IOneParser objects can assume that this is the case, so
they need to break down PUNC tokens (if necessary) into smaller tokens
in order for parsing to succeed.<br>


<br>


The meat of this breakdown process is implemented in a separate class and interface,
BasicPuncDivider and IOperatorDivider. BasicPuncDivider is given a PUNC token and a list of
operators, and outputs the same interpretation that a typical lexer
would produce. A second class, PuncDividerSource, implements
IParserSource and wraps around another IParserSource to translate PUNC
tokens using BasicPuncDivider.<br>

<br>

Although BasicPuncDivider only provides one interpretation of the
tokens,&nbsp;IOperatorDivider allows a divider&nbsp;to produce multiple
interpretations of a token.&nbsp;PuncDividerSource and BasicOneParser,
in turn, support multiple interpretations in priority
order:&nbsp;BasicOneParser first attempts to parse the input using the
first interpretation, then moves on to other&nbsp;interpretations if it
cannot parse the first.
<h3>The angle bracket ambiguity</h3>


A similar nasty issue is the double-angle bracket/right-shift
ambiguity&nbsp;in C++ and C#. A C++&nbsp;compiler can't understand
a&nbsp;declaration using nested generic types&nbsp;such as<br>


<pre>Stack&lt;Stack&lt;String&gt;&gt; list;</pre>


because the lexer assumes "&gt;&gt;" is a right-shift operator. So the C++ programmer writes <br>


<pre>Stack&lt;Stack&lt;String&gt; &gt; list;</pre>


instead. However, in C# the first declaration works just fine, and certainly in Loyc it should work too.<br>


<br>


By the way, I would point out that without type information, the first
declaration looks like an expression as well as a variable declaration:<br>


<pre>(Stack &lt; Stack) &lt; (String &gt;&gt; list);</pre>


The solution to this ambiguity is to give priority to variable
declarations: if it looks like a variable declaration, it is. What's
more, I think I'll use&nbsp;a conventional parser rather than a ONEP
for declarations. But template types can appear within expressions too:<br>


<pre>Console.WriteLine(Foo() is&nbsp;Stack&lt;Stack&lt;String&gt;&gt;);<br></pre>


Firstly, the current design of PuncDividerSource offers no way for
"&gt;&gt;" to be interpreted as two separate tokens in the presence of
the right-shift operator, although this could be dealt with by writing
a implementation of IOperatorDivider that could find other token breakdowns if the original
interpretation can't be parsed.<br>


<br>


Secondly, it's hard for a ONEP to handle stuff in angle brackets
because it may contain a comma-separated list. Commas usually have very
low precedence of 94, so the natural operator formulation<br>


<pre>ID '&lt;' e94 '&gt;'</pre>


is not good enough because the subexpression <span style="font-weight: bold;">e94</span> may catch too much, for example<br>


<pre>a &lt; b &amp;&amp; c &gt; -d</pre>

could get interpreted&nbsp;as a type expression (a&lt;(b &amp;&amp;
c)&gt; - d). This particular problem can be dealt with, but parsing
will be slower because two passes will occur, one to interpret it with
angle brackets and again&nbsp;to interpret it with greater/less than
symbols.<br>


<br>


But Loyc is always flexible when it comes to parsing because it doesn't
require&nbsp;a fixed pipeline or a particular parser-generator. To me
it seems that a reasonable solution to the "generic arguments" problem
in C# is to write a module to detect "angle brackets" during or after
the parsing stage. It would look inside PUNC tokens for a '&lt;'
character, and from there test whatever follows to see if it looks like
a generic argument list. If so, '&lt;' and '&gt;' would be converted
into LANGLE and RANGLE tokens; the LANGLE and RANGLE and everything in
between is collapsed to a ANGLES token, in the same way the LPAREN and
RPAREN are collapsed to PARENS.<br>


<h2>The effect of tree parsing</h2>


To reiterate,&nbsp;the tokens of an expression like f(x[y]*z) + 42 are converted to a&nbsp;tree before expressions are parsed:<br>


<pre>'f'          (ID)<br>PARENS<br> |__'x'      (ID)<br> |__BRACKS<br> <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">...</span> |__'y'  (ID)<br> |__'*'      (PUNC)<br> |__'z'      (ID)<br>'+'          (PUNC)<br>'42'         (INT)</pre>


(I wish I had a good tool for making diagrams.)<br>


<br>


Because of this,&nbsp;the OneParser only sees 'f' PARENS '+' '42'
initially. At the tree level, parsing proceeds outside-in;
subexpressions in brackets are only parsed at the request of the
bracket operator (i.e. the PARENS operator, the function-call operator,
the BRACKS operator, or whatever operator applies to the stuff in
brackets). This provides a lot of flexibility, because operators
can&nbsp;switch to a completely different parser inside brackets. I
could define an SQL operator, for example:<br>


<pre>'sql' BRACES</pre>


which would match code like<br>


<pre>sql { SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE FirstName LIKE "dav%" }</pre>


This operator could then parse the stuff in the curly brackets
with&nbsp;a separate SQL parser. Traditional approaches to
parsing don't allow a user-defined extension to do <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span>! The operator could even be expressed this way:<br>


<pre>BRACES '&lt;--' 'that' 'was' 'sql'<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span><br>{ SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE FirstName LIKE "dav%" } &lt;-- that was SQL</pre>

A construct like this is hard&nbsp;for a conventional left-to-right parser to deal with.<br>

<br>

Another reason for tree parsing is that my BasicOneParser algorithm
could be very slow in some cases if it had to handle brackets, because
of the fact that it's only LL(1) and evaluates multiple possibilities
in a repetitive brute-force kind of way. For instance if these two
operators were defined:<br>


<pre>'evaluate' e100 'carefully'<br>'evaluate' e100 'quickly'<br></pre>


Upon seeing the&nbsp;token 'evaluate',&nbsp;BasicOneParser would try to
match each of the two operators, one after the other, repeating the
parsing work twice. Without tree parsing, if the input was<br>


<pre>evaluate x[y + z] * <br>   f(g(d, e, f), h(g, h, i), a * b * (c+d+e+f) / (g+h+i)) quickly</pre>


Then the whole expression would be evaluated twice; but with tree parsing, only the simpler expression<br>


<pre>'evaluate' 'x' BRACKS '*' 'f' PARENS 'quickly'</pre>


will be examined twice.
<h2>Formal description of an IOneParser</h2>




Gotcha! There is no formal description of a&nbsp;ONE parser. In
fact I'm not certain what the exact semantics <span style="font-style: italic;">should be</span>; I know
that there are a lot of problems to look at. For example, suppose the
parser is given these operators:<br>




<pre>e12 ':' e12          // "Range" operator in some languages<br>e22 '**' e22         // exponentiation<br>'-' e25              // negation<br>e36 '-' e36          // subtraction<br>e36 '+' e36          // addition<br>e50 'is' e10         // C# type test<br>e82 '?' e100 ':' e82 // if-then-else (a.k.a. ternary) operator in C/C++/C#/Java<br>'if' e100 'then' e100 'else' e84     // Another if-then-else<br>'if' e100 'then' e84                 // This time with an ambiguity<br>e89 '=' e89          // assignment<br>INT                  // integer<br>ID                   // identifier<br>PARENS               // expression in parentheses<br>e8 PARENS            // function call, e.g. Math.Cos(0)<br>PARENS e8            // type cast, e.g. (IList&lt;int&gt;) list</pre>

Now consider the following expressions.<br>




<h3>-2 ** -1 - 3 (Minus two raised to the power of -1, minus 3)</h3>




A&nbsp;smart guy in&nbsp;math class&nbsp;would understand
this expression to&nbsp;mean<br>




<div>
<pre>-(2 ** (-1)) - 3</pre>




</div>




But there's a potential difficulty for a parser here, because the negation
operator has a <span style="font-style: italic;">lower</span>
precedence than exponentiation. By conventional thinking, there
shouldn't be an operator with lower precedence contained within an
operator that has higher precedence (unless it is in brackets, of
course). But if the parser doesn't accept the -1,&nbsp;the
expression can't be parsed.<br>




<br>




BasicOneParser's approach to parsing solves this problem, as I'll show
later.<br>



<h3>(A) (B)</h3>
This input matches the type cast operator and the function-call
operator equally well. Which should be chosen? I'm really not sure how
this should be handled.

<h3>a ? b : c : d</h3>




This expression is ambiguous; it can be interpreted&nbsp;as one of<br>




<pre>a ? (b : c) : d<br>a ?&nbsp;b : (c : d)<br></pre>




Note that it cannot be ((a ?&nbsp;b : c) : d), which would
be&nbsp;contrary to the precedence levels.<br>




<br>




The question is, how can a parser figure out that it is ambiguous? And
how can it do so in a reasonable amount of time? We can easily create
lots of ambiguity by adding new operators; for example if there is
another ':' operator with a different precedence:<br>




<pre>e50 ':' e50 // Let's call it :2 so we can tell it apart from the first one</pre>




Then an expression like (a : b : c : d) can be parsed in a lot of
different ways that all seem reasonable:<br>




<pre>(a : b) : c) : d    // interpretation 1<br>(a :2 b) :2 c) :2 d // interpretation 2<br>(a : b) :2 c) :2 d  // interpretation 3 <br>(a : b) : c) :2 d   // interpretation 4 <br>(a : b) :2 (c : d)  // interpretation 5 <br>a :2 ((b : c) : d)  // interpretation 6</pre>




How could a parser find all these interpreations in the first place?
Perhaps it should find them all and give the operators the opportunity
to disambiguate between them; for example, if the ':2' operator has
special case code that will refuse the expression unless the
subexpression operator is ':' on both sides, then only interpretation 5
will be accepted; therefore, the expression (a : b : c : d) turns out
to be&nbsp;unambiguous.<br>




<br>




But even if the parser can find these interpretations, how can it avoid
spending a long time searching for possibilities? If you thought it was
hard to handle the above case, just try parsing (a : b : c : d : e : f
: g : h : i). In some applications there is a security concern here,
because a remote denial-of-service attack can be accomplished by giving
special input that takes a very long time to process, or that uses an
excessive amount of memory.<br>




<br>




My BasicOneParser implementation can only find one interpretation for the original
expression (a ? b : c : d), namely, a ? (b : c) : d. As for the case of the two ':' operators, I'll get back to that.<br>


<h3>if a then if b then x else y</h3>

This is the classic dangling else ambiguity. There are two possible interpretations:<br>

<pre>if a then (if b then x else y)<br>if a then (if b then x) else y</pre>

Such
an ambiguity is not normal in expression parsing;&nbsp;else is never
optional. But if it were, this ambiguity could arise. The conventional
rule in this case is that the first interpretation should succeed; the
question is, how can operators communicate this desire to the parser?<br>

<br>

BasicOneParser
can detect and report this problem. Unfortunately, my current design
for disambiguating operators does not provide an easy&nbsp;way to decide
between the interpretations. One operator can claim higher priority in
the other, so the if-then-else could, for example, say it has higher
priority than if-then. But in this expression, both operators are
present in both interpretations, and&nbsp;the priority distinction doesn't
help (forgive me for not explaining completely). The standard solution
is to associate the else with the innermost if, but this desire can't
be expressed directly.<br>




<h3>The juxtaposition operator</h3>




Suppose we add this operator to the list:<br>




<pre>e92 e92</pre>




This is just two expressions side-by-side, and it is used in many
functional languages. Unfortunately, it causes ambiguity very easily.<br>




<ul>




  <li>f(x) can be interpreted&nbsp;as a function call or as
the juxtaposition of f and x. In functional languages the juxtaposition
operator actually represents a function call, so the solution is to
delete&nbsp;the function call operator from the list.</li>




  <li>(Foo) x can be interpreted&nbsp;as a type cast or as
the juxtaposition of Foo and x. If type names are known during parsing,
one way to handle it is to see if Foo is a type name and assume it is a
type cast if so. However, in Loyc it is not always&nbsp;guaranteed
that all type names are known, nor that the context of the expression
is available. Also, what code would perform this test? The code for the
type cast operator, or the code for the juxtaposition operator? How
should the preference be communicated to the parser?</li>




  <li>10 - 5 can be interpreted&nbsp;as subtraction or as
(10) (-5). Haskell must&nbsp;face&nbsp;this problem, and
interprets this case as subtraction. But what mechanism can be employed in an extensible language to resolve this ambiguity?</li>




</ul>




<h3>Text versus token types</h3>




Operator parts that match text should have higher priority than those
that match tokens. For example, the&nbsp;operator<br>




<pre>e8 'is' 'crap' '-' 'tastic'</pre>




<div class="sidebox">Something that should be pointed out
here: an operator that combines the last three strings into one string,&nbsp;'crap-tastic', <span style="font-style: italic;">cannot
match anything</span>. That's because each part is matched
against a single token, and there is no way a single token could have the text
'crap-tastic' because the lexer would have&nbsp;broken it up into three tokens.</div>




can only match strings such as "chili is crap-tastic".
But without some kind of special rule, the interpretation<br>



<pre>(chili is crap) - tastic</pre>




(using the 'is' and '-' operators) is also valid. But in that case,
'crap' and 'tastic' are matched as ID tokens and ID expressions, but
not as text strings. A parsing algorithm should automatically
prioritize the exact-match interpretations, otherwise ambiguities like
this may pop up whenever an operator uses a word that is not a reserved
word.<br>



<h3>Tuples</h3>



Tuples are ordered lists of data with a specific length; in some languages they have this syntax:<br>


<br>


(3*4, "twelve", 12.0)<br>


<br>


Note that the brackets are part of the syntax. It's not a tuple without
them. The question is, how can we detect tuples under the ONEP parsing
model?<br>


<br>

One approach is to define a new PARENS operator (with a different
human-visible Name property). This produces an ambiguity every single
time a subexpression in parenthesis is encountered, creating a lot of
disambiguation work for the parser.<br>

<br>

Another approach is for the PARENS operator to expose some kind of hook
that the tuple operator would latch onto and change the interpretation
of the contents of the parenthesis, perhaps by splitting the sub
expression on comma boundaries and calling the IOneParser on each
subexpression (or calling the normal PARENS handler&nbsp;if there are
no commas.)<br>




<h2>BasicOneParser</h2>




BasicOneParser is a sort of recursive-descent LL(1) parser with backtracking. It works well for common situations, but it
is limited primarily because it cannot produce a <span style="font-style: italic;">parse forest</span> (a
graph or a group of parse trees). Partly because of
this, it can see ambiguity when there is none, and it can fail to
detect some interpretations.<br>




<br>



Let's start off with an example that uses the operators defined earlier:<br>



<pre>a&nbsp;- b + c    // the token types for "a - b + c" are ID PUNC ID PUNC ID</pre>



I will now begin parsing this expression "by hand" in much the same way
BasicOneParser does it. I've developed a notation to show the steps
that the parser goes through. BasicOneParser begins parsing at position
0 with a&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">precedence limit</span> of 999, which is assumed to be a higher number than any operator uses (the conventional maximum is 100). I will denote this as<br>



<pre>|999|</pre>



We start by examining the first token of the input. I'll use (?'a') to denote that we're checking out the first token:<br>



<pre>|999| (?'a')</pre>



It searches for an operator that starts with either "a" or&nbsp;ID (ID
is the token type of "a"). There is one match, the "identifier"
operator. After matching ID, I denote the parser state as <br>



<pre>|999| ID.</pre>



Here, the parser has successfully matched the input, "a", against the
"identifier" operator which consists of a single ID token.&nbsp; The
dot after the 'a' indicates that 'a' has been matched successfully.<br>



<br>



At this point the operator is "reduced" to an expression:<br>



<pre>|999| e{a}</pre>



"e" means expression here, and {a} is just a summary of what the expression contains. Then the next token is examined:<br>



<pre>|999| e{a} (?'-')</pre>



(?'-') indicates that&nbsp;the next token is a '-'. An expression has
already been found, so the parser is now looking for an operator that
begins with an expression with precedence less than or equal to 999.
There is one match: the subtraction operator.<br>



<pre>|999| e{a} '-'. e36</pre>



At this point the objective is to scan through to the end of the
subtraction operator. On the left side of the dot is what has already
been matched (the expression 'a' and the token '-'); on the right side
of the dot is the stuff that hasn't been matched yet. Notice that the
'-' can be assumed to match because&nbsp;it was found during the search
for operators.<br>



<br>



BasicOneParser uses two pairs of lookup tables that are used to
determine quickly which operators may start with a given input. The
first pair is for operators that start with a token or text, and the
second pair is for operators that start with an expression followed by
something else.&nbsp;Each&nbsp;pair consists of one lookup table to
help find a specific text string, and another&nbsp;to help find a
specific token type.<br>



<br>



By this point, all four lookup tables have been consulted once. The
first pair was searched for an operator that starts with ID or 'a'. The
second pair was used to find an operator that starts with an expression
followed by PUNC or '-'.<br>



<br>



We're not done, but let's review: the input was<br>



<pre>a - b + c</pre>



And when we're done, it should be understood like this:<br>



<pre>((a) - (b)) + (c)</pre>



and the sequence of steps so far was <br>



<pre>|999| (?'a')<br>|999| ID.<br>|999| e{a} (?'-')<br>|999| a{a} '-'. e36</pre>



The next step is to match something against e36. This is another
expression, and we can match this inner expression in much the same way
we are matching the outer expression. The parser calls itself, this
time with a precedence limit of 35:<br>



<pre>|999|35| (?'b')</pre>



Why 35 and not 36? I'll explain in a minute. Now, 'b' matches the identifier operator:<br>



<pre>|999|35| ID.<br>|999|35| e{b}<br>|999|35| e{b} (?'+')</pre>



At each recursion depth, the parser is greedy, meaning it matches as
much as possible. Right now it is looking for an operator that begins
with a subexpression followed by '+', but the search is limited by the
precedence limit of 35. The addition operator does not match because it
starts with e36, which is too high. That's&nbsp;good: it should not be
used yet. If we matched '+' then we would end up with the subexpression
(b + c), which is incorrect because + and - are left-associative, not
right-associative.&nbsp;For this reason, BasicOneParser reduces the
precedence limit by 1 when beginning to match a left-associative
operator. This is not done for right-associative operators; for
instance the assignment operator (e89 '=' e89) keeps its limit at 89.<br>



<br>



Therefore, matching stops and the result is e{b}. Now we return to the previous level:<br>



<pre>|999| a{a} '-' e{b}.</pre>



We're at the end of the operator, so we reduce it to an expression:<br>



<pre>|999| e{a-b}<br>|999| e{a-b} (?'+')</pre>



Again we search for an operator that starts with an expression and '+';
the precedence limit is 999 so the addition operator matches this time.<br>



<pre>|999| e{a-b} '+'. e36</pre>



We match e36, but again reduce the&nbsp;precedence level to 35 because&nbsp;36 is a left-associative precedence level.<br>



<pre>|999|35| (?'c')<br>|999|35| ID.<br>|999|35| e{c}<br>|999|35| e{c} (?$)</pre>



$ is a symbol that some people use to represent EOF (end of file); in
this case, I use it to mean end of input. Nothing can match the end of
input, so we return the expression we already have:<br>



<pre>|999| e{a-b} '+' e{c}.<br></pre>



We reduce it to the expression<br>



<pre>|999| e{e+c}</pre>



Here, e+c means "some expression 'e' (which I won't bother to write
down again) plus c". The idea is just to keep the notation brief so
these summaries don't get to long. Finally, the parser looks at the
next token:<br>



<pre>|999| e{e+c} (?$)</pre>



Oops, this is the end, so the parser returns the final expression e{e+c}, or in other words, ((a)-(b))+(c).<br>



<br>



Let's do another example, for the input <br>



<pre>a = b ? c + d : 0 // Token types: ID PUNC ID PUNC ID PUNC ID PUNC INT</pre>



First 'a' is matched:<br>



<pre>|999| (?'a')<br>|999| ID.<br>|999| e{a}</pre>



Then the parser starts matching the assignment operator:<br>



<pre>|999| e{a} (?'=')<br>|999| e{a} '='. e89<br></pre>



The parser uses recursion to match e89:<br>



<pre>|999|89| (?'b')<br>|999|89| ID.<br>|999|89| e{b}<br>|999|89| e{b} (?'?')<br>|999|89| e{b} '?'. e100 ':' e82</pre>



Okay, you know how I explained about how the precedence limit is
reduced by 1 for left-associative operators? Well I didn't tell you
everything. The ternary operator is left-associative, but the concept
of associativity only really applies at the end of an operator. Here,
e100 is sandwiched between '?' and ':' so the parser leaves it be so
that, hypothetically, if there were an operator with precedence
100&nbsp;between '?' and ':', it could still be matched.<br>



<br>



Later I will explain that precedence limits are normally cumulative, but that doesn't apply here either. So let's match e100:<br>



<pre>|999|89|100| (?'c')<br>|999|89|100| ID.<br>|999|89|100| e{c}<br>|999|89|100| e{c} (?'+')<br>|999|89|100| e{c} '+'. e36<br>|999|89|100|36| (?'d')<br>|999|89|100|36| ID.<br>|999|89|100|36| e{d}<br>|999|89|100|36| e{d} (?':')<br>|999|89|100| e{c} '+' e{d}.<br>|999|89|100| e{c+d}<br>|999|89|100| e{c+d} (?':')</pre>



All done. So e{c+d} is returned to the surrounding rule, and then we match the colon (':'):<br>



<pre>|999|89| e{b} '?' e{c+d}. ':' e82 (?':')<br>|999|89| e{b} '?' e{c+d} ':'. e82</pre>



The next task is to match e82. This time associativity applies, so the precedence limit is reduced by 1.<br>



<pre>|999|89|81| (?'0')<br>|999|89|81| INT.<br>|999|89|81| e{0} (?$)<br></pre>



The expression e{0} is returned and the ternary operator is completed, and then the assignment operator is completed too:<br>



<pre>|999|89| e{b} '?' e{c+d} ':' e{0}.<br>|999|89| e{b?e:0}<br>|999|89| e{b?e:0} (?$)<br>|999| e{a} '=' e{b?e:0}.<br>|999| e{a=e}<br>|999| e{a=e} (?$)</pre>



And that's the end. The result is (a) = ((b) ? ((c) + (d)) : (0)).<br>


<h3>Ambiguity</h3>


<br>

Prioritisation<br>

<br>

Suppose the following operators are defined:<br>

<pre>ID&nbsp; /* identifier */<br>e36 '-' e36 /* subtraction */<br>'-' e36 /* negation */<br>e100 e100 /* juxtaposition */<br></pre>

Now, the expression "a - b" is ambiguous. It coule mean "a - b" using
the subtraction operator or (a) (-b) using the juxtaposition and
negation operators. There are three<br>
