        <member name="T:Loyc.Ecs.EcsNodePrinter">
            <summary>Prints a Loyc tree to EC# source code.</summary>
            <remarks>
            This class is designed to faithfully represent Loyc trees by default; any
            Loyc tree that can be represented as EC# source code will be represented 
            properly by this class, so that it is possible to parse the output text 
            back into a Loyc tree equivalent to the one that was printed. In other 
            words, EcsNodePrinter is designed to support round-tripping. For round-
            tripping to work, there are a couple of restrictions on the input tree:
            <ol>
            <li>The Value property must only be used in <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.LiteralNode"/>s,
                and only literals that can exist in C# source code are allowed. For 
                example, Values of type int, string, and double are acceptable, but
                Values of type Regex or int[] are not, because single tokens cannot
                represent these types in C# source code. The printer ignores Values of 
                non-literal nodes, and non-representable literals are printed out
                using ToString().</li>
            <li>Names must come from the global symbol pool (<see cref="F:Loyc.GSymbol.Pool"/>).
                The printer will happily print Symbols from other pools, but there is
                no way to indicate the pool in source code, so the parser always 
                recreates symbols in the global pool. Non-global symbols are used
                after semantic analysis, so there is no way to faithfully represent
                the results of semantic analysis.</li>
            </ol>
            Only the attributes, head (<see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LiteralNode.Value"/>, 
            <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.IdNode.Name"/> or <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.CallNode.Target"/>), and arguments 
            of nodes are round-trippable. Superficial properties such as original 
            source code locations and the <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Style"/> are, in 
            general, lost, although the printer can faithfully reproduce some (not 
            all) <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.NodeStyle"/>s. Also, any attribute whose Name starts with 
            "#trivia_" will be dropped, because these attributes are considered 
            extensions of the NodeStyle. However, the style indicated by the 
            #trivia_* attribute will be used if the printer recognizes it.
            <para/>
            Because EC# is based on C# which has some tricky ambiguities, there is a
            lot of code in this class dedicated to special cases and ambiguities. Even 
            so, it is likely that some cases have been missed--that some unusual trees 
            will not round-trip properly. Any failure to round-trip is a bug, and your 
            bug reports are welcome. If this class uses prefix notation (with 
            #specialNames) unnecessarily, that's also a bug, but it has low priority 
            unless it affects plain C# output (where #specialNames are illegal.)
            <para/>
            This class contains some configuration options that will defeat round-
            tripping but will make the output look better. For example,
            <see cref="P:Loyc.Ecs.EcsNodePrinter.AllowExtraBraceForIfElseAmbig"/> will print a tree such as 
            <c>#if(a, #if(b, f()), g())</c> as <c>if (a) { if (b) f(); } else g();</c>,
            by adding braces to eliminate prefix notation, even though braces make the 
            Loyc tree different.
            <para/>
            To avoid printing EC# syntax that does not exist in C#, you can call
            <see cref="M:Loyc.Ecs.EcsNodePrinter.SetPlainCSharpMode"/>, but this only works if the syntax tree
            does not contain invalid structure or EC#-specific code such as "==&gt;", 
            "alias", and template arguments ($T).

            <c>x * (a + b)</c>. Originally, the second tree had a significantly 
            different structure from the first, as parenthesis were represented
            by a call to the empty symbol @``. This was annoyingly restrictive, so 
            I reconsidered the design; now, parenthesis will be represented only by 
            a trivia attribute #trivia_inParens, so adding new parenthesis no longer
            changes the Loyc tree in an important way, so the default has changed
            from false to true (except in the test suite).

            For example, the tree <c>#if(c1, #if(c2, x++), y++)</c> will be parsed 
            incorrectly if it is printed <c>if (c1) if (c2) x++; else y++;</c>. This
            problem can be resolved either by adding braces around <c>if (c2) x++;</c>,
            or by printing <c>#if(c2, x++)</c> in prefix notation.

            <remarks>This class not only preprocesses C# source code, it saves 
            preprocessor directives and comments so that any code excluded by the 
            preprocessor can be added back in later, if and when the parsed code is 
            printed out. For example, given input like this:
            <code>
               void foo // see below
               #if false
               invalid code!
               #endif
               () { Console.WriteLine("foo()!"); }
            </code>
            EcsPreprocessor removes the #if...#endif region of tokens, creates a 
            single Token of type TokenType.PPFalseBlock to represent that region, and
            saves it, after the "see below" comment token, in a list.
            <para/>
            C# has the following preprocessor directives:
            <code>
            #define Id
            #undef Id
            #if expr
            #elif expr
            #else
            #endif
            #warning {arbitrary text}
            #error {arbitrary text}
            #region {arbitrary text}
            #endregion
            #line 123 "filename"

            <summary>Tests handling of the constructor ambiguity</summary>
            <remarks>
            Constructors look like ordinary method calls. In fact, EC# parsing
            rules do not allow the parser to look at the argument list to 
            determine whether a method is a constructor, and method bodies are
            not required on methods. Furthermore, the parser does not 
            distinguish between executable and non-executable contexts. So
            it's impossible to tell whether
            <code>
            Foo(x);
            </code>
            is a method or a constructor. To resolve this conundrum, the parser
            keeps track of the name of the current class, for the sole purpose
            of detecting the constructor. The printer, meanwhile, must detect
            a method call that may be mistaken for a constructor and reformat 
            it as <c>##(Foo(x));</c> or <c>(Foo(x))</c> (<c>##(...)</c> is a
            special form of parenthesis that does not alter the syntax tree that
            the parser produces). Also, when a constructor definition is printed,
            the missing return type must be included if the name does not match
            an enclosing class:
            <code>
            @`` Foo(int x) { ... }
            </code>
            When the constructor is called 'this', this(x) is assumed to be a 
            constructor, but that creates a new problem in EC# because you will 
            be allowed to call a constructor inside a constructor body:
            <code>
            this(int x) { this(x, x); }
            </code>
            This parses successfully because the parser will not allow 
            constructor definitions inside methods. The printer, in turn, will
            track whether it is in a space definition or not. It can print a
            constructor that is directly within a space definition, but in other
            contexts will use the @`` notation to ensure that round-tripping 
            succeeds. When the syntax tree contains a method call to 'this' 
            (which is stored as #this internally, but always printed simply as 
            'this'), it may have to be enclosed in parens to avoid ambiguity.
            <para/>
            Finally, a constructor with the wrong name can still be parsed if
            it calls some other constructor with a colon:
            <code>
            class Foo { Fub() : base() { } }
            </code>

            <remarks>
            Reasons for disallowing non-keyword attributes (known as "word attributes"):
            <para/>
            - On expressions, consider: "partial X();"
              Ambiguity: is this a method declaration, or a method call X() with an attribute?
            - On expressions, consider: "partial x = 0;"
              Ambiguity: is this a variable declaration, or an assignment "x = 0" with an attribute?
            - On the "if" statement, consider "Foo X if (x) { get; }":
              Ambiguity: is it a conditionally-defined property or a regular "if" statement?
            - On constructors, consider "partial X() {}"
              Ambiguity: is this a constructor or a method that returns type "partial"?
              However: we can allow word attributes on a new-style constructor named "this"
            - On forwarded accessors, consider "foo get ==> X;"
              Ambiguity: is this a property forwarded to X with return type "foo", or is it
              a getter forwarded to X with "foo" as a word attribute?
            <para/>
            Reasons for disallowing "new":
            <para/>
            - On expressions, consider: <c>new Foo();</c> or <c>new Foo[10] = x;</c>
              Ambiguity: does this create a new Foo, or is it just a call to method Foo with "new" as an attribute?
              Ambiguity: does this create a new array, or is it just a call to an indexer on the variable Foo?
            <para/>
            Word attributes should be allowed on "return", to allow "yield return".
