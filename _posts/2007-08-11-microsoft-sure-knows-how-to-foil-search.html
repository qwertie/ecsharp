I have been trying to learn COM and .NET development lately, but every time I try to search for COM and .NET related stuff on Google, it seems like I get any website that has .com or .net in the domain name. Plus, search engines are harly able to tell the difference between C, C++, C# and pages that are indexed by their first letter. For .NET I've got around this problem by searching for ".NET framework" or CLR, but for COM there seems to be no way to find information about it.<br/>

What TLA will they come up with next? THE? FOO?<br/>

P.S. My 80-gig secondary hard drive has died. It's only a matter of time before my 200-gig explodes...
