<h1>Loyc Design Overview</h1>

<h2>It's not just a compiler</h2>



<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>It will be
possible to take
parts of the compiler and use them for different purposes.
The&nbsp;design of the compiler architecture should consider the
needs
of<br>



<ol>



  <li>Source tweaking tools: taking a program, parsing it, making
small
changes and emitting the result as a new source file, keeping the
original spacing and comments (unless, of course, the tool's job is to
modify whitespace and comments).</li>



  <li>Syntax translation tools: taking source code and changing
its syntax to that of a new language. Loyc should include a standard
method of keeping comments intact during nontrivial transformations.</li>



  <li>Refactoring tools: making specific user-directed
transformations on-demand, probably in an IDE</li>



  <li>Semantic translation tools: taking&nbsp;source code and
changing its structure to do the same tasks in a new way (without
specific refactoring directions from a user)</li>



  <li>Smart text editors: "syntax" highlighting based on code
semantics
as well as syntax; using knowledge of program structure to display
completion lists and other information; ability to hide code based on
structure; showing call graphs and dependency graphs; finding
errors even before compiling. </li>



  <li>Quick compilation: pre-parsing code in a text editor so it
builds faster when the user wants to run the code</li>



  <li>Interactive usage: typing statements/expressions and
getting an immediate result</li>



  <li>Edit and continue: applying a user's&nbsp;code changes
to a running program<br>



  </li>



</ol>



Loyc will not have all these features at first--that could take
years, even if I have a lot of help. But the architecture should not
make any of the above tools excessively hard to write.
The&nbsp;compiler should be modularized in such a way that the
above
tools do not have to re-write or even re-compile any functionality that
exists in the compiler itself.<br>



<br>



For example, a code editor that does basic syntax highlighting should
be able to use the same parser in the same DLL that is used
by&nbsp;the
compiler. A parser design that reads directly from a file, or that must
parse a whole file at once, is unsuitable.
<h2>It's not just a fixed language</h2>



As I've said, it's not enough to support a single language. It's also
not enough to allow the user to select a single desired grammar for the
language, nor is it enough to let the parser&nbsp;be swapped out
for
another one. I want a system that allows many different people
to&nbsp;add their own syntax to the language, <span style="font-style: italic;">independently of each other</span>.
One guy adds syntax for unit checking, another adds embedded SQL,
another adds an operator specifically for his class library, another
adds some crazy functional thing like monads*.
<div class="sidebox">*They didn't teach me monads in school
:(</div>



I want to
see all
this stuff work together, certainly in the same source file and maybe
in the same expression. When a&nbsp;programmer comes along who
wants to
use these features, he or she should just have to add some new options
on the compiler command-line and it just works. Inevitably, there will
be conflicts and ambiguous syntax, but it should be rare.<br>



<br>



To this end I propose an front-end with several "hooks" in it where
new syntax can be tacked on. The architecture will have an empirical
design, that is, an ad-hoc design that works
best with particular kinds of syntax. My hope is that
with
the right kind of overall front-end
design,&nbsp;any useful feature can be added with little
impact on other features. And in the event that a syntax cannot be
added with the standard methods, there will still be&nbsp;the
option
of replacing the parser or adding another stage to the parsing
pipeline.<br>



<br>



When new syntax is added, mechanisms are required for controlling
when&nbsp;it is active. I assume most syntax extensions will not be
active
globally throughout a source file; rather the user will turn them on in
specific lexical blocks, or they will be active with respect to
specific functions or data types. I will discuss later
how&nbsp;this
"selective" syntax can be achieved, and what selection mechanisms will
be available. The ability to turn syntax on and off is crucial if
different extensions are to coexist, because <br>



<ol>



  <li>Different extensions may have incompatible syntax, so they
can't be used at the same time. (for example, they may have the same
syntax and Loyc can't tell them apart.)</li>



  <li>When
a user adds a new extension, it should not change the meaning of
existing code, so it should usually be inactive until it is
specifically requested.</li>



</ol>



As much as possible, the compiler should detect and report conflicts,
such as ambiguity between newly added operators.<br>



<br>



Finally, it should usually be easy to take a syntax designed for one
code style and transplant it to another--for example, to write a new
kind of "switch" statement for C# and then use it in boo, making
little or no changes to the extension.<br>



<br>



In the following subsections I discuss the kinds of syntax extensions
that should be supported.<br>



<h3>Brand new operators and brackets</h3>



Users should be able to make new operators, including ternary and other
complex operators. Examples:<br>



<ul>



  <li>a "to" operator that creates a range object: "1 to 10", "1
to 101
step 5". Or how about using a colon for the same purpose? "1:10",
"1:101:5".</li>



  <li>an "in" operator for testing membership in a set: "34 in
[12, 67, 34, 0]"</li>



  <li>chainable comparison operators: "0 &lt;= index &lt;
list.Count"</li>



  <li>long phrases like in COBOL. For example, consider this
exclusive-or operator: &nbsp;"x &gt; 0 or y &gt; 0 but not
both"</li>



  <li>inline assertions: "x (== y) + 1" could compute x + 1 while
asserting that x == y. An alternative syntax could be "(x |== y) + 1"
or taking the COBOL approach, "x (which equals&nbsp;y) + 1"</li>



  <li>multi-character operators. For example, one could define "x
|&lt;| y" to test whether "the magnitude of x is less than the
magnitude of y". However, just as "x &lt; &lt; = 8" is not a
valid way
to say "x &lt;&lt;= 8",&nbsp;"x | &lt; | y" would be
invalid also. </li>



</ul>



It should be possible to make an operator with a word in it without
reserving a new keyword globally. It should be possible for users to
overload new operators, although it's okay if the syntax creator has to
do more work to provide that possibility. The parser should be able to
determine that "a--b" means "a - (-b)" rather than
something&nbsp;invalid like "(a--) b" (unless, of course, a syntax
extension makes the first interpretation meaningful).<br>



<br>



I would find it exciting (in a purely platonic way) to allow end-users
to define one-off operators for particular functions. For example, it
would be cool if you could make a function<br>



<pre>void DrawLine(float&nbsp;x1, float&nbsp;x2 "to" float&nbsp;y1, float&nbsp;y2) { ... }</pre>



and call it like so:<br>



<pre>DrawLine(x1,y1 to x2,y2)</pre>



Now I'm not making guarantees, but I believe this is possible.<br>



<h3>New expression parsers</h3>



It should be possible&nbsp;to parse expressions in new ways,
although
it is assumed that one would rarely need to. Here are examples of
possible "alternative" parsers<br>



<ul>



  <li>Reverse Polish Notation (RPN): a syntax in which brackets
are unnecessary. For example, 3 4 + 5 * means (3 + 4) * 5.</li>



  <li>Precedence based on whitespace: a syntax in which spaces
can indicate precedence, so 3+4 * 5 means (3+4) * 5.</li>



</ul>



It should be possible to switch the parser&nbsp;within particular
blocks of code, but use the normal parser elsewhere.<br>



<h3>New reserved words</h3>



It should be possible, although not recommended, to reserve new
keywords globally throughout a source file.<br>



<h3>New attributes on classes, functions, enums and maybe other
things</h3>



As well as .NET attributes, functions and classes can by marked in
C#&nbsp;with special attributes such as "public" and "static". It
should be possible to mark functions, classes and perhaps other things
with new flags that have special meaning to an extension. The
main&nbsp;use of new flags would probably be&nbsp;to enable an
extension within a particular class or function.<br>



<h3>New kinds of lexical blocks</h3>



It should be possible&nbsp;to define new kinds of blocks, where the
interpretation of the&nbsp;contents of the block is controlled by
an
extension. The syntax allowed outside the block may be fairly limited.
For example, when using the C#-style language, one should be able to
write an extension that can be used at file scope (or inside namespace
blocks) that provides the syntax<br>



<pre>public globals {<br>	int thisVariableIsGlobal;<br>	void voodoo(float foo, bool bar) { <br>		Console.WriteLine("Wait, wait, a global function in C#?!")<br>	}<br>}</pre>



This extension would allow "global static" variables and functions that
can be used without a class name. Now although the interpretation of
the block is controlled by the extension, this particular extension
need not parse the contents. Instead it can invoke the normal parser
and then augment the AST after parsing to put it all in a class and
add "static" modifiers.<br>



<br>



Somebody who doesn't like how switch statements work in C# could write
a new statement that works more like Visual Basic:<br>



<pre>select (x) {<br>case y:<br>	Console.WriteLine("x equals y!!!!");<br>case is &gt;= 500000:<br>	Console.WriteLine("x is just too damn big!!!!");<br>}</pre>



<h2>But I need advice.<br>



</h2>



There are innumerable issues to consider and angles to cover. It is not
easy to make a design that meets the needs of hundreds of potential
extensions, "intellisense" editors, syntax translators, refactoring
tools, and all the rest while pleasing programmers at the same time. My
expertise comes from mainly from the many languages that I have used in
the past (namely VB, C, C++, Pascal, Java, C#, boo, Ruby, Haskell,
Javascript, Verilog, ANTLR, and a couple of assembly languages) and
from my drive to understand new techniques. But I am not experienced in
the following areas:<br>



<ul>



  <li>Administration of bug-tracking systems</li>



  <li>Administration of RCSs (SVN)</li>



  <li>Code emission (Reflection.Emit or anything else)</li>



  <li>Code optimization (I've merely read about the basics)</li>



  <li>Extension/plug-in frameworks (what kind of plug-in
architecture should I use?)</li>



  <li>Smart editors (How do they work? How do they function in
spite of syntax and semantic errors? How does Visual Studio avoid constantly re-parsing an entire program every time you press a
key?)</li>



</ul>



Also, there may be various other projects that could help me with Loyc;
for instance, related open-source projects, PhD theses, and academic
papers in programming-language research.<br>



<br>



If you <br>



<ul>



  <li>have advice about these topics</li>



  <li>have any opinions
about what an Ultimate Programming Language should contain</li>



  <li>are aware of open-source or academic projects related to my
work</li>



  <li>can suggest where the project should be hosted (I need a
wiki, bug-tracking system and&nbsp;SVN server)</li>



  <li>want to help develop or administer the project</li>



</ul>



please <a href="mailto:qwertie256@gmail.com">let me know</a>. Also let me know if you know someone who might be interested in the project.
<h2>Loyc Parsing System</h2>


I'm implementing an unconventional parsing system&nbsp;that separates
several aspects of syntax:<br>



<ul>



  <li>The language style - C, C#, VB, boo, etc. Informally the
term "style" may refer merely to the syntactic style of a language, but
in this case, the language style includes</li>



  
  
  <ul>



    <li>A&nbsp;set of lexical blocks and a specific syntax
for each. For example, C# style implies
that there will be class, namespace, method blocks, and much more.</li>



    <li>Specific lexing rules. For instance, in C# style, "_\"_"
is a
valid string, but not in Visual Basic. The
equivalent&nbsp;VB&nbsp;string
is "_""_". Lexing rules also govern whether comments can be nested,
whether 134_001 is a single valid integer (or two integers separated by
an underscore), and so on. Lexing rules apply throughout a file;
however, if needed, an extension can reinterpret a section of program
text with a different lexer.</li>



    <li>A set of rules governing the <span style="font-style: italic;">essential tree structure</span>
of the program, including statement breaks. In C and C# the essential
tree structure can be determined by tracking brackets {}, (), [], and
semicolons. In boo the structure is determined mostly by indentation
and line breaks, but also by brackets. VB is slightly more challenging
because there is no consistent rule for starting a block, but this is
mitigated by how easy it is to discover where statements begin and end.</li>



    <li>Unusual&nbsp;syntax elements, parsing rules or
behavior (e.g.
in C, #define statements or the syntax for declaring&nbsp;pointers
to
functions).</li>



    <li>Semantics governing identifier lookup, function
overloading, automatic coersion, and much more.</li>



  
  
  </ul>



  <li>The set of statements (class, struct, while loops, custom
blocks) that follow a standard syntactical pattern</li>



  <li>The set of operators available in expressions, including
information about precedence levels.</li>



  <li>The set of attributes that can be applied to functions,
classes, etc.</li>



  <li>The set of reserved words</li>



</ul>



<h3>
Rats!</h3>



I looked at a very cool parsing system yesterday called <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/papers/pldi06.pdf"><span style="font-style: italic;">Rats!</span></a>
(part of <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/rgrimm/xtc/">eXTensible
C</a>). <span style="font-style: italic;">Rats!</span>
is a modular compiler compiler which allows different parts of syntax
to be separated pretty easily; it also allows syntax to be expressed
very concisely, and little effort is required to build an AST. <span style="font-style: italic;">Rats!</span>
might make a good basis for Loyc, except for the fact that it is a
compiler compiler, not a runtime. See, I envision people taking a bunch
of ready-made extensions and slapping&nbsp;them together almost
effortlessly - with no compiling required to create the compiler
itself, and without any&nbsp;specification file saying how to put
the
extensions together. Just a few command-line arguments. Rats! requires
that the grammar be compiled, which generates source files that also
have to be compiled. It also requires a top-level module that might not
be easy for an ordinary programmer (who himself has never made a
compiler extension) to use.<br>



<br>



Another issue in <span style="font-style: italic;">Rats!</span>
is the way it sweeps ambiguities under the rug&nbsp;by saying their
aren't any. Yeah, in the <span style="font-style: italic;">theory</span>
of PEGs there aren't any ambiguities, but if two people
define expr!!expr operators that are both available at once,
practically speaking, there is a conflict that the user should be
informed of.<br>



<br>



However, none of this is&nbsp;a deal breaker. But the fact
that&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Rats!</span>
only generates Java code is.<br>



<h3>
ANTLR</h3>



ANTLR 3 seems to be a better fit fo this project. Its new parsing
algorithm looks awesome, and as a recursive descent parser, it is
possible to parse parts of code&nbsp;"by hand" if necessary. It is
written in Java, but targets C# and&nbsp;it appears that
one can use IKVM to convert ANTLR to .NET. Even if not, it just
means that one needs to install Java before one can compile the
parser(s).<br>



<br>



ANTLR includes support for the type (1) tools mentioned at the
beginning of this document. It's possible to parse a source file, make
some changes, and emit the output as a modified source file with
original spacing and comments intact.<br>



<br>



ANTLR doesn't support modularity the way <span style="font-style: italic;">Rats!</span>
does, but that's okay because grammar-level modularity is not the means
by which syntax extensions will be made possible. Instead, users are
expected to add extensions by tacking on DLLs.<br>


<br>


Unfortunately, ANTLR 3 C# seems extremely buggy and the developers
(except Jim Idle, who doesn't work on the C# stuff) have ignored my bug
reports. After wrestling with ANTLR 3 for three or four weeks and
failing to find reliable workarounds for the bugs, I decided that
writing a parser-generator could be a nice proof-of-concept for Loyc's
extensibility. So I'm planning to make a parser generator for&nbsp;Loyc
and then using it to write parsers for boo and C#. I'm bootstrapping by
writing a boo lexer and parser by hand.<br>



<h3>CoCo/R</h3>



I have not investigated other possible code generators such as CoCo/R.<br>



<h3>Proposal</h3>



I propose a multi-stage parsing framework with the
following steps:
<ol>



  <li>Byte source (disk file or other source =&gt; bytes)</li>



  <li>Code extraction (bytes =&gt; characters)</li>



  <li>Preprocessing (characters =&gt; characters)</li>



  <li>Lexing (characters =&gt; tokens)</li>



  <li>Essential tree parsing (tokens =&gt; minimal AST)</li>



  <li>Main parsing (minimal AST =&gt; complete AST)</li>



</ol>



The first three&nbsp;stages are essentially optional; normally,
characters would be extracted directly from a text file. But you can
imagine that someone might want to compile code from a zip file or
compile code that is embedded in a word-processing document (*.doc,
*.odt), and&nbsp;run a preprocessor on the result.<br>



<br>



Normally, stages 3 to 6 will be selected according to the language
style (C#, boo, etc.) However, each of these stages will have hooks
within it to control the set of available blocks, operators, attributes
and reserved words, and "preprocessors" can be inserted between the
stages.
<h2>Essential tree parsing (ETP)<br>



</h2>



This stage attempts to discover to <span style="font-style: italic;">essential
tree structure</span>
of a language. I noticed that for most languages, you can discover a
lot about "what is nested within what" while understanding only a
little about the souce text. For example, in C, C#, C++, and Java,
braces and brackets normally indicate nesting regardless of the context
in which they appear. The same goes for boo, except that indentation
also indicates structure. In VB and Ruby, it's not quite as easy to
tell where a code block begins; you need to recognise specific patterns
like "If ... Then" and "Do While ..." (VB) and "if ..." and "while ..."
(Ruby). For the most part blocks end in a consistent way, however. In
Haskell, although indentation represents structure, special logic is
required to see the beginning&nbsp;of a block. Despite these
difficulties, I think that it is not too hard to make an ETP system
that can cooperate with syntax extensions, provided that the syntax
added to a language follows certain rules.<br>



<br>



The main caveat is that brackets and braces (and indentation,
sometimes)
are meaningless in certain lexer contexts:<br>



<br>



void f() { char* c = "(}"; /* (]{)}[ */ }<br>



<br>



Obviously, the brackets/braces inside comments and strings must be
ignored, and this is true regardless of the language style. For that
reason, ETP is done after lexing.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>



</span>
<h4>Why do ETP?</h4>



ETP enables parsing algorithms written by different people to be used
at different places within the same source file, without combining
their grammars. Loyc assumes that source files may contain
domain-specific languages as well as new types statements such as the
"globals" and "select" statements mentioned earlier; ETP allows
out-of-order parsing, so that information can be gathered from one part
of a source file before another part (including earlier parts) has even
been parsed. I believe this will come in handy in some DSLs.<br>



<br>



I am hoping that the ETP technique may help&nbsp;smart code editors
(you know, intellisense, autocompletion, etc.) keep track of the
classes and methods that exist in a program even when that program
contains syntax errors. Of course, at the very moment you type "foo."
and a completion list pops up, the code contains a syntax error. ETP
can isolates syntax errors in a function, so that the rest of the
program can be parsed successfully. Mind you I don't actually know much
about smart code editors, but I have a solid educated guess that ETP is
A Good Thing for them.<br>



<br>



By doing ETP as one of the first steps of parsing, a mismatched
bracket/brace error tends to be the first one discovered, but the
nature of the error is not
necessarily obvious (especially since the
ETP doesn't know much about the program). However, two heuristics
should be able to suggest
an error's location&nbsp;accurately most of the time. For instance,
given this nonsense C-style code:<br>



<pre>Gosh (*flat[ulance]<br>{<br>	Gapulus!(carpoony+++garb);<br>}&nbsp;</pre>



it is clear that since C languages always match ( with ), [ with ] and
{ with }, there is probably a missing ")" at the end of the first line,
and it doesn't take a human to figure that out.&nbsp;Note, however,
that this heuristic could be confused by a domain-specific language
that allows [unusual) bracket matching.<br>



<br>



The second heuristic is indentation. In code like<br>



<pre>if (naru[cam]) { // Line 1<br>	while (&amp;%sinbur[ger] $= "!!!") // Line 2<br>		triprper = 7;<br>		snub();<br>	} // Line 4<br>	goobernatorial(triprper);<br>} // Line 6</pre>



Any human can see that there is a brace missing on line 2, because
there is a closing brace on line 4 at the same indentation level (and
all lines in-between are indented more). But a parser will detect no
problem until reaching line 6. That's where most compilers will report
an error, but it can be really annoying to get an error on line 1798
when the problem is on line 921. As long as the parser tracks
indentation, it can report a good guess of the problem location (in
addition to the location where the parser got stuck); and perhaps it
can even recover from the error, in order to go on and discover more
errors.<br>



<br>



Notice the&nbsp;importance of error recovery in smart code editors,
which are expected to keep working in code&nbsp;with syntax errors.
However, I don't plan to implement a sophisticated recovery feature for

<h4>The output of the ETP parser</h4>
ETP produces a kind of AST of tokens. Each level of the tree can be
thought of as a token stream with children removed. For example, the C
code<br>



<pre>if (foo) { foo(bar); } else bar++;</pre>



comes out of the lexer as<br>



<pre>IF LPAREN foo RPAREN LBRACE foo LPAREN bar RPAREN SEMI RBRACE ELSE bar PUNC SEMI</pre>



(here uppercase words are the names of token types and lowercase words
are ID tokens.) Next,<br>



<pre>IF LPAREN RPAREN LBRACE RBRACE ELSE bar PUNC SEMI</pre>



comes out of the ETP. &nbsp;Hidden inside the LPAREN and LBRACE tree tokens are more
tokens; for example LBRACE contains<br>



<pre>foo PARENS SEMI.</pre>



Now rather than creating an entirely new set of tokens, ETP re-uses the
same tokens but places them in a different&nbsp;list.
<h2>The statement recognition algorithm</h2>



When I looked at several languages, I noticed that
many&nbsp;constructs could be identified in similar ways.<br>



<h3>C</h3>



<pre>struct .... class ...<br>typedef ...<br>while (...) ...<br>if (...) ...<br>do ...<br>for (...) {...}<br>template ...<br></pre>



After filtering out preprocessor directives, in C/C++ there are many
constructs that can be identified with the first word, although the
remaining constructs (variables, functions, expressions) are aweful,
messy
beasts. Notice that we can check the first word of a statement and if
it matches one of the above, we don't even have to consider whether the
statement is a messy beast. But that's assuming we can tell where
statements begin--which is equivalent to detecting where statements
end. I'll propose the solution to that later.<br>



<br>



If statements are identified in this way, it is a good idea to support
"substatements". For example, template&lt;class T&gt; could be
followed
by a struct, class, variable or function declarations. One way to look
at this is that "template" begins a statement and that which follows
the angle brackets is a substatement.<br>



<br>



There are two different kinds of "statements" here: executable code,
and declarative statements. At the file level, only declarations are
allowed, but within function definitions, the two types may be mixed;
variable, struct, class, and typedef statements can&nbsp; appear
alongside executable statements.<br>



<br>



Preprocessor statements should be treated specially because they can't
be recognised properly with a single grammar. Consider that the
following is valid C++:<br>



<pre>template&lt;<br>#define FOO T<br>class FOO&gt; class why_would_anyone_write_crap_like_this { T foo; }<br></pre>



I suppose it wouldn't be a great loss if the parser couldn't
handle it, but it's good to do things by-the-book whereever possible.<br>



<h3>C#</h3>



<pre><span style="font-style: italic;">attributes</span> class ...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">attributes</span> struct ...<br>using ...<br>namespace ...<br></pre>



"attributes" includes .NET attributes in [square][brackets], and
keywords such as <span style="font-weight: bold;">virtual</span>
and <span style="font-weight: bold;">static</span>.
Again, there are a small number of preprocessor directives that may
require special treatment, and some constructs such as variable
declarations that are not identified by&nbsp;a keyword.<br>



<br>



Notice that some constructs allow attributes while others do not; but
since this language is extentable, people may invent
reasons&nbsp;to put attributes on any construct. Therefore, the
syntax can be regularized to<br>



<pre><span style="font-style: italic;">attributes</span> special_word ...</pre>



Then, invalid attributes can be detected after parsing rather than
during it. The main difficulty I see is distinguishing this kind of
construct from&nbsp;variable declarations, function declarations
and expressions.<br>



<h3>boo</h3>



boo, like Python, uses indentation to indicate structure and a
very&nbsp;regular syntax like this:<br>



<pre>import Namespace.Name<br><span style="font-style: italic;">attributes</span> class ... :<br><span style="font-style: italic;">attributes</span> struct ... :<br><span style="font-style: italic;">attributes</span> def ...:<br>if ...:<br>else:<br>while ...:<br>for ...:<br></pre>



much as in C#,&nbsp;keywords&nbsp;mark the start of most
statements.<br>



<br>



Look at this boo code:<br>



<pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">def</span> bar(z):<br>	print "foo!" + z.ToString()<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">class</span> Bar:<br>	b <span style="font-weight: bold;">as int</span>, a <span style="font-weight: bold;">as int</span>, r <span style="font-weight: bold;">as int</span><br><br>name = "Bob"<br>print "Hello ${name}"<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: monospace;">def </span></span>Foo(foo as int): // ERROR<br>	<span style="font-weight: bold;">return</span> foo * foo</pre>



As shown, boo can contain executable statements that are
lexically&nbsp;at file scope. There is a special rule: as soon as
an
executable statement is reached, the "main" function (the entry point
of the program) begins. Here, the main function starts at <span style="font-weight: bold;">name = "foo"</span>.
After this, no more declarations are allowed, including function
declarations. To enforce this rule properly, statements must be
classified as imperative or declarative.<br>



<h3>Haskell</h3>



And now for something completely different.<br>



<pre><span style="font-weight: bold;">module</span> Foo <span style="font-weight: bold;">where<br>import</span> <span style="font-family: monospace;">ModuleName<br><br></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">data</span> Tree a = Node Tree Tree<br> | Leaf a<br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">deriving</span> (Eq)<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">instance</span> Show Tree <span style="font-weight: bold;">where</span><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; show (Node a b) = "{ " ++ (show a) ++ " " ++ (show b) ++ " }"<br> show (Leaf a) = show a<br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">-- split a list into two lists: ([1st, 3rd, 5th element...], [2nd, 4th, 6th, ...])</span> <br>msplit:: [a] -&gt; ([a],[a])<br>msplit (o:e:rest) = (o:os, e:es)<br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">where</span> (os, es)&nbsp;= <br> msplit rest<br>msplit [] = ([], [])<br>msplit x = (x, [])<br></pre>



Ok, I'm not so talented at Haskell so that code is probably wrong. And
if I don't look at Haskell code very often,&nbsp;I forget what it
means. But anyway, brackets indicate structure and so do newlines and
indentation. Whenever one of four special keywords (<span style="font-weight: bold;">let</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">where</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">of</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">do</span>) is encountered,
a "block" is opened implicitly. As long as lines that follow are
indented <span style="font-style: italic;">more</span>,
they are part of the same block (<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Indentation">see
here</a>
for more details). In this way, the ETP should be able to discern the
tree structure. Unlike in most languages, the same function can be
defined more than once (each definition matches a different <span style="font-style: italic;">pattern</span>).<br>



<br>



I suppose that for a language like this, the top-level statements (the
ones that do not begin with whitespace) would be considered statements.
Here, the statements are&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">import</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">data</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">instance</span>,&nbsp;function
declarations, and possibly <span style="font-weight: bold;">module</span>
(but it is probably better to treat it specially since it can only
appear at the beginning of a file). The block-opening keywords are
typically used in expressions, they could be considered statements too.
It seems to me that <span style="font-weight: bold;">data</span>,
<span style="font-weight: bold;">instance</span>,
and function definitions can be considered the declarative statements
of Haskell, while subexpressions that contain blocks can be considered
"executable" statements. In this view, a function contains either a
series of guards or a single statement. A statement&nbsp;is either
an
expression or one of the following statement types:<br>



<pre>where-stmt: expr <span style="font-weight: bold;">where</span>&nbsp;assignment* -- (does it start with a stmt or an expr?) <br>do-stmt: <span style="font-weight: bold;">do</span> stuff -- (monads!)<br>let-stmt: <span style="font-weight: bold;">let</span>&nbsp;assignment* <span style="font-weight: bold;">in</span> stmt<br>case-stmt: <span style="font-weight: bold;">case</span> stmt <span style="font-weight: bold;">of</span> stuff&nbsp; &nbsp;-- (does it contain a stmt or an expr?)<br></pre>



The syntax of "stuff" is not really important (with regard to&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">do</span>, they didn't
teach us about monads), but what Haskell has in common with the other
languages is that <span style="font-style: italic;">some</span>
common statements&nbsp;begin with a special word (<span style="font-weight: bold;">do</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">let</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">instance</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">type</span>).
A major difference is that&nbsp;executable statements in Haskell
must
return a value, although there is an empty value () that perhaps could
be used by an extension that prodices no value. Also, since Haskell is
a lazy functional language, some major transformations may be applied
to change code from functional to imperative form, which must be done
before&nbsp;a computer can execute it; running functional code
directly
is impractical, as in this classic "fibonacci sequence" example:<br>



<br>



fibonacci&nbsp;0 = 0<br>



fibonacci&nbsp;1 = 1<br>



fibonacci n = (fibonacci (n-1)) + (fibonacci (n-2))<br>



<br>



This code works fine in Haskell, but the apparently equivalent C# code<br>



<pre>int&nbsp;fibonacci(int n) {<br>	if (n == 0) return 0;<br>	if (n == 1) return 1;<br>	return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);<br>}</pre>



Will run very slowly for even small values of&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">n</span> (e.g. n=20) and
will overflow the stack if <span style="font-weight: bold;">n</span>
is very large. The point is, functional programs often require
transformations that make them practical to execute. Unfortunately I
have no idea what the transformations are, or how&nbsp;extensions
should interact&nbsp;with those transformations.<br>



<h3>Summary</h3>



After stripping out preprocessor directives and comments, the syntax of
most languages can be distilled down to this:<br>



<pre>header stmt*</pre>



where header is something (such as the <span style="font-weight: bold;">package</span> statement in
Java and <span style="font-weight: bold;">module</span>
in Haskell) that must come before all statements, and stmt* is a
sequence of&nbsp;zero or more statements. Statements can contain
expressions and/or statements; if they contain other statements then we
call them <span style="font-style: italic;">block
statements</span>.
Statements can be declarative (class, struct, ...) or imperative (if,
while, ...). In general, not all statements are available at the same
time.<br>



<br>



There are two kinds of statement syntax: regular and messy. "Regular"
statements start with a reserved word (or at least a <span style="font-style: italic;">special word</span>),
possibly preceded by a list of attributes, while messy statements are
things like variable declarations in C, which are not identified by a
special word, and the <span style="font-weight: bold;">where</span>
statement in Haskell which is not identified as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">where</span> statement
until after the expression to which it applies.<br>



<br>



Given a starting point in a&nbsp;token stream, I have discussed how
to
detect which type of&nbsp;statement begins there, but I haven't
said
how the end of a statement can be detected.
<h3>Proposal</h3>



<br>



<br>



In most languages, the appropriate mechanism for adding new types of
statements is to register a special word (which may or may not be a
keyword) that the statements , possibly&nbsp;preceded by a list of
"attributes". The set of possible attributes is also <br>



Thus, following the pattern of the other languages, users could define
new statements in terms of a word that starts off the statement.<br>



<h2>Syntax extension mechanisms</h2>



<br>



<h2>Caveats for extension designers</h2>



<ul>



  <li>Extensions should not worry about where they are in the
class
hierarchy. Although some code is located in class X now, it may be
somewhere else after all extensions have been run.</li>



</ul>



<h2>Security concerns</h2>



Using extensions implies running code by third parties (or shifty-eyed
employees) at compile time. Obviously this suggests room for abuse;
however, at the moment I don't know a cure for this problem. It would
be nice if extensions' access to the file system and network were
blocked by default, but I do not know how to enforce a block (does
Microsoft offer a way for programs to run untrusted code with
restrictions?)<br>



<br>



If an extension that allows code to run at compile-time, it would be
desirable that the resulting code also be restricted. Note
that&nbsp;code generation per se is not an unsafe activity, as long
as
generated code that is run at compile-time, is run with the same
restrictions as the code that created it.<br>



<br>



Of course, an extension can insert anything it wants into the code
being compiled; a malicious extension could insert a virus. There is no
practical way to detect maliciousness automatically. Loyc will have a
"flattened output" option that will print the source code after all
"normal" extensions have been run, so one can manually check that
nothing weird has been added. However,&nbsp;coders will normally
want
to see the source before optimization because optimization could
produce weird-looking code whose behavior is not readily obvious. Thus,
one may implement a malicious extension as an "optimizer" in order to
sneak in evil code. There's just no way to prevent this except to make
sure you trust the extensions you use.<br>
