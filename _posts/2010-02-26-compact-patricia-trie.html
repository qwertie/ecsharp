I am not quite sure why I did it, but after learning about Judy, I had this obsession with bringing something comparable to .NET. I basically failed, so then instead I made a crazy data structure called a CPTrie. It's like a normal trie, but really compact! And much slower, I imagine. So I spent the last 3 days working on <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/cptrie.aspx">a CodeProject article about it</a>. Enjoy! It is included in Loyc.Utilities.dll.
