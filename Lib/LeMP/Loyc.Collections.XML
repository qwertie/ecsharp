            <summary>A bijection is a one-to-one function and its inverse. It is 
            implemented with a pair of dictionaries, one that maps K1 to K2 and
            another that maps K2 to K1.</summary>
            <typeparam name="K1">Default key.</typeparam>
            <typeparam name="K2">Inverse key.</typeparam>
            <remarks>
            The Bijection object that you first create is a dictionary from K1 to K2.
            Call the <see cref="P:Loyc.Collections.Bijection`2.Inverse"/> property to get the inverse dictionary from
            K2 back to K1. Whenever you modify one of the dictionaries, the other 
            dictionary is also modified in the same way. 
            <para/>
            For example, if you do this:
            <code>
              var map = new Bijection&lt;int,string&gt;() { { 1, "one" }, {2, "two"} };
              map.Add(3, "three");
              map.Inverse.Add("four", 4);
              map.Inverse.Remove("two");
            </code>
            Then the bijection will contain three pairs: <c>{1, "one"}, {3, "three"}</c> 
            and <c>{4, "four"}</c>. The inverse bijection object map.Inverse is "first-
            class" and can be used just like the original map. The two interfaces, <c>map</c>
            and <c>map.Inverse</c>, are linked to each other, so 
            <c>map.Inverse.Inverse == map</c>.

            <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.AList`1"/> and <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.BList`1"/>.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            You can read <a href="http://core.loyc.net/collections/">articles</a> about
            the AList family of data structures online.
            <para/>
            <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.AList`1"/> and <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.BList`1"/> are excellent data 
            structures to choose if you aren't sure what your requirements are. The 
            main difference between them is that BList is sorted and AList is not. 
            <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.DList`1"/>, meanwhile, is a simpler data structure with a 
            faster indexer and lower memory requirements. In fact, the leaf nodes
            of this class are built upon <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalDList`1"/>.
            <para/>
            Classes derived from AListBase typically have the following abilities:
            <ul>
            <li>Items can always be inserted or removed in O(log N) time (by convention,
            N refers to the number of items in the list, although it is the 
            <see cref="P:Loyc.Collections.AListBase`2.Count"/> property that actually returns this number).</li>
            <li>Elements can also be accessed by index in O(log N) time.</li>
            <li>Scanning the list with an enumerator or foreach loop takes O(1) time 
            per element (plus O(log N) to initialize the enumerator), and it is 
            possible to start enumerating somewhere in the middle of the list.</li>
            <li>The list can be frozen with <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.AListBase`2.Freeze"/>, making it read-only.</li>
            <li>The list can be cloned in O(1) time and space, with incremental copy-
            on-write semantics. Thus, changing either copy of the tree costs extra time
            and space in order to duplicate parts of the tree that are changing. A 
            frozen list can be cloned to produce a non-frozen list. In the language of
            comp-sci techno-babble, A-lists are related to the family of "persistent"
            data structures, although I could not find a term that describes the form 
            of persistence that A-lists support.</li>
            <li>Changes can be observed through the <see cref="E:Loyc.Collections.AListBase`2.ListChanging"/> event.
            The performance penalty for this feature is lower than for the standard
            ObservableCollection{T} class.</li>
            <li>Changes to the tree structure can be observed by writing a class that
            implements <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.IAListTreeObserver`2"/> and calling 
            <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.AListBase`2.AddObserver(Loyc.Collections.Impl.IAListTreeObserver{`0,`1})"/>.</li>
            <li>A section of the list can be cloned in O(log N) time, although there is 
            no time savings when extracting a small section.</li>
            <li>Removing a contiguous group of items takes O(log N + M) time, where M is
            the number of items being removed.</li>
            <li>A reversed view of the list is given by the <see cref="P:Loyc.Collections.AListBase`2.ReverseView"/> 
            property, and the list can be enumerated backwards, also in O(1) time 
            per element.</li>.
            </ul>
            Derived classes provide the following additional capabilities:
            <ul>
            <li><see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.BList`1"/> and <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IndexedAList`1"/> allow you to 
            find items in O(log N) time. BList is a sorted B+tree, so it achieves this 
            ability through a kind of binary search, while IndexedAList uses a special 
            kind of hashtable maintained in parallel with the tree.</li>
            <li><see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.BList`1.FindLowerBound(`0)"/>allows you to find the closest 
            larger item to an item that is not in the list. For example, if a BList(of 
            int) contains { 1, 3, 9 }, you can search for 5 in order to find 9.</li>
            <li><see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.AList`1"/> allows a contiguous group of items to be 
            inserted in O(log N + M) time, where M is the number of items being 
            inserted.</li>
            <li><see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.AList`1"/> allows you to concatenate two lists in O(log N) 
            time, where N is the size of the combined list, although there is no time
            savings when combining small lists.</li>
            <li><see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.AList`1"/> has a special sorting algorithm that allows you 
            to sort the list in slightly more than O(N log N) time. This is slower than
            sorting an array or <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.List`1"/>, but faster than a quicksort 
            applied directly to <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.AList`1"/>, which would take O(N log^2 N) 
            time.</li>
            </ul>
            As you can see, the A-List family of data structures allows you to 
            accomplish a wide variety of tasks efficiently, so the letter "A" in A-List 
            stands for All-purpose.
            <para/>
            A-Lists use memory efficiently because they are similar to B+trees. A-Lists 
            tend to use slightly more memory than <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.List`1"/> but have lower 
            peak memory usage, because their size never suddenly doubles. A-Lists use 
            much less memory than <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.HashSet`1"/>, so they are useful for 
            storing large data sets in RAM.
            <para/>
            The efficiency of various operations is affected by the maximum sizes of the
            inner nodes and leaf nodes, which can be set independently when constructing 
            an <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.AList`1"/> or <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.BList`1"/>. Generally, larger leaf
            nodes allow faster indexing but slower insertions and removals. If the list
            is cloned frequently, smaller inner and leaf nodes will speed up all 
            modifications (insertions, removals, and modification of individual items), 
            although small node sizes suffer increased overhead (higher memory usage and 
            slower indexing). The default inner node size of 16 is usually best for 
            performance, because the binary searches required for lookups will have good
            locality-of-reference. Small size limits (less than 8) have a high overhead 
            and are not recommended for any purpose except unit testing. The minimum
            allowed maximum node size is 3.
            <para/>
            In general, the tree is structured so that indexing is faster than 
            insertions and removals, even though these three operations have the same 
            scalability, O(log N).
            <para/>
            In general, this family of classes is NOT multithread-safe; concurrency 
            support is the only major feature that AListBase lacks. It supports 
            multiple readers concurrently, as long as the collection is not modified,
            so frozen instances ARE multithread-safe. However, classes derived from 
            AListBase must not be accessed from other threads during any modification. 
            There is a mechanism to detect illegal concurrent access and throw 
            InvalidOperationException if it is detected, but this is not designed to be 
            reliable; its main purpose is to help you find bugs. If concurrent 
            modification is not detected, the AList will probably become corrupted and 
            produce strange exceptions, or fail an assertion (in debug builds).
            <para/>
            Although AListBase provides neither concurrent operations nor safety for
            concurrent modification, the fast-clone feature makes it a useful parallel 
            data structure. Consider, for instance, a document editor that wants to 
            run a spell-check on a background thread, with an AList(of Char) object 
            representing the document. The spell checker cannot access the document 
            if the user might modify it concurrently; luckily, it can be cloned 
            instantly before starting the spell-checking thread. The root of the AList's
            B+ tree is marked frozen, and when the user modifies the original document,
            the AList will duplicate a few frozen nodes in order to modify them without
            crashing the spell-check operation that is running concurrently. You will,
            of course, have to deal with the fact that the spell-check results apply 
            to an old version of the document, but at least the program won't crash 
            and the user won't be blocked from editing while the spellcheck is running.
            <para/>
            The disadvantage of the fast-clone approach is that the immutability of the
            tree cannot be cancelled. So if the spell-check finishes after a half-second
            and the user did not modify the document, the tree still remains frozen and
            will still have to be copied later when the user does modify it. Still, the
            copying is a pay-as-you-go cost, so the app will stay responsive and the 
            entire tree will not be copied unless you make widespread changes to the 
            collection (e.g. converting the document to all-uppercase.)

            * Actually it is possible in a B+ tree, but requires a specially-
              designed derived class. Specifically, it is necessary to store 
              key-value pairs in inner nodes instead of just keys (so K := T),
              and to implement two different sorting functions. One sort function
              only compares keys, but this function can only be used for find
              and remove operations. The other function compares entire key-value 
              pairs in order to find an exact match (note that this requires 
              ordered values); this second function must be used for all add 
              operations, otherwise the tree may not stay sorted. In this kind
              of tree, replacements are generally unsafe (unless the new key and 
              value both compare equal to the old key and value).

            <ul>

            </ul>
            An observer object should be attached to only one list, because change

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Indexes that are passed to methods such as Index, this[] and RemoveAt are
            not range-checked except by assertion. The caller (AList or BList) is 
            expected to ensure indexes are valid.
            <para/>
            At the root node level, indexes have the same meaning as they do in 
            AListBase itself. However, below the root node, each node has a "base 
            index" that is subtracted from any index passed to the node. For example, 
            if the root node has two leaf children, and the left one has 20 items, then 
            the right child's base index is 20. When accessing item 23, the subindex 3 
            is passed to the right child. Note that the right child is not aware of its 
            own base index (the parent node manages the base index); as far as each 
            node is concerned, it manages a collection of items numbered 0 to 
            TotalCount-1.
            <para/>
            Indexes are expressed with a uint so that nodes are capable of holding up 
            to uint.MaxValue-1 elements. AList itself doesn't support sizes over 
            int.MaxValue, since it assumes indexes are signed (some protected methods
            in AList take unsigned indexes, however). It should be possible to support 
            oversize lists in 64-bit machines by writing a derived class based on 
            "uint" or "long" indexes; 32-bit processes, however, don't have enough 
            address space to even hold int.MaxValue bytes.
            <para/>
            Before calling any method that modifies a node, it is necessary to call
            AutoClone() to check if the node is frozen and clone it if necessary.
            TakeFromRight and TakeFromLeft can be called when one or both nodes are 
            frozen, but will have no effect.
            <para/>
            Philosophical note: the kinds of features I'd like to see in Enhanced C#
            would make it easier to create the AList series of data structures. Each
            kind of AList is similar yet different and many of the operations of an
            AList are similar yet different and C# doesn't, I think, provide enough
            flexibility to handle this variety without smooshing a bunch of different 
            things clumsily into a single class hierarchy and without having to write
            methods that are in charge of several different operations (e.g. 
            DoSingleOperation). Traits and D-style templates would help make the cod
            of the AList family of types cleaner and faster.

            <remarks>
            The <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IndexedAList`1"/> class uses one of these objects to speed
            up methods that search for items in an <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.AList`1"/> (IndexOf,
            Contains, and Remove). The amount of speedup is limited by the size of
            the nodes in the list being indexed; see <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.AListIndexer`2.IndexOfAny(`1)"/>.
            <para/>
            It is wasteful to use an AListIndexer if the list is small. AListIndexer
            is designed to accelerate searches in very large lists, and it offers no
            performance benefit to small lists; to the contrary, it just wastes time
            and memory in small lists.
            <para/>
            It is recommended to use IndexedAList instead of instantiating this class 
            directly.
            <para/>
            In general, AListIndexer requires more memory than the list that is being
            indexed. Specifically, if pointers use P bytes, then AListIndexer itself
            consumes moderately MORE than X+P*N bytes of memory, where X is the size 
            of the list being indexed, and N is the number of items in the list. Thus,
            for example, an indexed list of <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.AList`1"/> requires 
            approximately three times as much memory as an AList that is not indexed.
            <para/>
            Moreover, changing an indexed list takes at least twice as much time, since 
            the indexer must be notified of each change and updates to the index take
            O(log N) time per update. Batch operations involving X items that take 
            O(log N) time without an indexer (e.g. RemoveRange(i, X)) will take 
            O(X log N) time instead, because the indexer must be notified about each 
            item changed.
            <para/>
            Still, these costs are worthwhile in applications that frequently search
            for items in the list.

            <remarks>
            The search takes O(M log^2 N) time, where N is the size of the list 
            and M is the maximum size of nodes in the list. Due to the "M" factor,
            A-lists with large nodes are searched more slowly than A-lists with 
            small nodes; however, the "log N" part is a base-M logarithm, so you
            don't actually gain performance by using very small nodes. This is
            because very small nodes require deeply nested trees, and deep trees 
            are slow. The <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.AListBase`2"/> documentation discusses

            To illustrate how to use <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.NestedEnumerator`2"/> let's 
            consider the case of binary tree traversal. Suppose you define this data
            structure to hold a subtree of a sorted binary tree of strings:
            <code>
            internal class StringNode : IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;
            {
                internal StringNode LeftChild;
                internal string Value;
                internal StringNode RightChild;
                public IEnumerator&lt;string&gt; GetEnumerator() { ... }
            }
            </code>
            You want to write an enumerator that returns all the strings in order.
            So you write this method in the StringNode class:
            <code>
            public IEnumerator&lt;string&gt; GetEnumerator()
            {
            	foreach(string item in LeftChild)
            		yield return item;
            	yield return Value;
            	foreach(string item in RightChild)
            		yield return item;

            NestedEnumerator helps to solve this problem using a "virtual stack". It 
            keeps track of all the nested enumerators and always returns values from 
            the current, deepest enumerator. The enumerator objects are called "frames",
            because they are "stack frames" on the virtual stack.
            <para/>
            Each enumerator implements <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.IEnumeratorFrame`2"/> instead
            of just <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator`1"/>. A normal enumerator can only do one
            of two actions on each call to MoveNext(): it can return a T value, or stop.
            But an <c>IEnumeratorFrame</c> can do one of three things: it can return a T
            value, it can stop, or it can return a new (child) stack frame. These actions
            are represented by <c>MoveNext</c> return values of 1, 0, and -1 respectively.
            <para/>
            You cannot use <c>yield return</c> with <c>NestedEnumerator</c> because it 
            is not supported by the C# compiler, so using <c>NestedEnumerator</c> 
            requires more developer effort. Here's how the GetEnumerator() method can 
            be implemented using <c>NestedEnumerator</c>:
            <code>
            public IEnumerator&lt;string&gt; GetEnumerator()
            {
            	return new NestedEnumerator&lt;Frame, string&gt;(new Frame(this));
            }
            struct Frame : IEnumeratorFrame&lt;Frame, string&gt;
            {
                StringNode self;
                int step;
                public Frame(StringNode self) { _self = self; step = 0; }
                
                int MoveNext(ref Frame frame, ref T current)
                {
                    switch(++step) {
                        case 1: frame = new Frame(self.LeftChild);  return -1;
                        case 2: current = Value;                    return 1;
                        case 3: frame = new Frame(self.RightChild); return -1;
                    }
                    return 0;

            The <c>NestedEnumerator</c> takes care of managing the stack and invoking

            <para/>
            <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.IEnumeratorFrame`2"/> is an unusual interface that 
            requires <c>Frame</c> to be derived from the interface itself. The purpose 
            of this design is to allow the <c>Frame</c> data type to be a struct,
            which allows the virtual stack to consist of value types (structs), which
            improves performance because a new object does not have to be allocated on
            the heap for every stack frame. Also, if <c>Frame</c> is a struct, 
            NestedEnumerator can call <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.IEnumeratorFrame`2.MoveNext(`0@,`1@)"/>
            directly, rather than via interface dispatch, which also improves 
            performance.

        <member name="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.KeylessHashtable`1">
            <summary>
            A fairly obscure space-saving hashtable that offers no built-in way to 
            store keys, only values. Because there are no keys, the hashtable cannot
            be rehashed when it is full, and searching for a given key finds all
            values in the same bucket, some of which may be unrelated.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            My primary primary motivation for this data structure is compactness. It's 
            comparable to a "counting bloom filter", in that searching for a key can
            find false positives, but not false negatives, but it offers the additional
            feature that one or more values can be associated with each key.
            <para/>
            The size per entry dependends on the size of the hashtable. This data 
            structure is the most compact when its size is limited to 65536 entries and 
            buckets; its overhead doubles when you exceed this limit, since "shorts" 
            become "ints".
            <para/>
            The Count is allowed to exceed the Capacity, but it is not allowed to cross
            a size threshold (255 or 65535). Capacity returns the number of buckets,
            so if Count exceeds Capacity, it simply means there are more items than 
            buckets, so there will be a larger-than-normal amount of "false positives" 
            (multiple items will typically be returned from a search).
            <para/>
            The size requirement per entry is 2 bytes (plus sizeof(T)) for a table of
            size 255 or less, 4 bytes (plus sizeof(T)) for a table of size 65535 or 
            less, and 8 bytes (plus sizeof(T)) for larger tables. Prime number sizes
            are generally preferred for best performance.
            <para/>
            The memory for buckets (1-4 bytes) is allocated up-front, but other memory
            is allocated on-demand. For example, if you create a new hashtable with 
            capacity 251 and add 50 items, 251 bytes are allocated up-front, but less
            than 100 * (1+sizeof(T)) additional bytes are allocated.
            <para/>
            By its very nature, KeylessHashtable allows multiple values to be 
            associated with a single key.
            <para/>
            A normal hashtable could theoretically be built on top of this one by
            storing the key and value together in type T.

            I plan to use this base class as an optimization, to implement ITags in 
            Loyc AST nodes. It is important that AST nodes, which are immutable, use as 
            little memory as possible so that copies can be made as quickly as possible
            (and so that Loyc isn't a memory hog). By using WListProtected as a base 
            class, AST nodes can have extra attributes attached to them without 
            allocating a separate heap object that would have to be cloned every time 
            the node's immutable attributes change. Consequently, nodes use 12 bytes 
            less memory and can be copied faster.
            <para/>
            Besides that, WListProtected provides an extra byte of storage in UserByte 
            that AstNode uses to optimize access to a tag without enlarging the object.

            <li>This class supports fast cloning and overloads the following operators
            to perform set operations: &amp; (intersection), | (union), - (subtraction, i.e.
            <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.MSet`1.ExceptWith(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{`0})"/>) and ^ (xor, i.e. <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.MSet`1.SymmetricExceptWith(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{`0})"/>.
            These operators clone the left-hand argument, so they benefit from fast-
            cloning functionality.</li>

            <b>Note:</b> this class is designed with the assumption that there are an

            set-testing operations such as Equals() and IsSubsetOf() can return false
            when they should return true. For example, consider two sets of bytes:
            one set holds the numbers 0..100, and the other contains 101..255 but is
            marked as inverted. Arguably, Equals() and IsSubsetOf() should return true
            when comparing these sets, but they return false because they are unaware 
            of the finite nature of a byte.
            <para/>
            Performance warning: GetHashCode() XORs the hashcodes of all items in the
            set, while Equals() is a synonym for SetEquals(). Be aware that these 
            methods are very slow for large sets.

            <summary>A trie that supports signed and unsigned keys with sizes up to 64
            bits. Special encodings are used to preserve the sort order among integers
            of different sizes while using variable-length keys.</summary>
            <typeparam name="TValue">Type of value associated with each key.</typeparam>
            <remarks>This trie allows you to insert integers of different sizes. Two
            integers of different sizes that have the same value are considered
            equivalent. You can insert a key as an Int16, then extract it as an Int32,
            for example.
            <para/>
            This collection implements two versions of IDictionary: one using Int32
            keys and another using Int64 keys. When calling a method on the class
            itself (i.e. not on an interface), Int64 is used in case of ambiguity (for
            example, GetEnumerator() doesn't know if you want to decode the keys into
            Int32 or Int64, so it uses Int64.) When not accessing CPIntTrie through an
            interface, most methods accept any of the following integer types: Int16,
            UInt16, Int32, UInt32, Int64, UInt64.
            <para/>
            The trie does not choose the key length based on an integer's size (e.g.
            Int32 or Int64), rather it is chosen based on the key's magnitude. Keys
            ranging from -0x10000 to 0xFAFFFF are encoded most compactly (usually in one
            4-byte cell); 40-bit keys as low as -0xFFFFFFFFFF and as high as
            0xFFFFFFFFFF are usually encoded in 2 cells; and all larger keys require 3 
            cells.
            <para/>
            I say "usually" because normally CPSNode can hold 3 bytes per cell, but
            keys whose low-order byte is 0xFD, 0xFE or 0xFF require one extra cell.
            <para/>
            Negative 64-bit numbers can be held in the same trie as unsigned 64-bit 
            numbers; therefore, there is no way to represent all keys using a single
            primitive data type. The LongEnumerator returns Int64s, and you will find 
            that if a huge unsigned number like 0x8877665544332211 is in the trie, it 
            will come out as a negative Int64. To find out whether the long number is 
            signed or unsigned, call ContainsKey(Int64) - if it returns true, the
            number is signed, otherwise it is unsigned (so its signed representation
            was not found). If it is unsigned, convert the key returned by the
            enumerator to UInt64.

            <summary>
            VListBlock implements the core functionality of FVList, RVList, FWList and 
            RWList. It is not intended to be used directly.
            </summary><remarks>
            VList is a persistent list data structure described in Phil Bagwell's 2002
            paper "Fast Functional Lists, Hash-Lists, Deques and Variable Length
            Arrays". I (David P) call the .NET equivalent "FVList" or "forward VList".
            In the forward VList, the "beginning" of the list (index 0) is by far the 
            fastest place to insert items.
            <para/>
            This is unnatural in .NET, so I also created a second data structure, the
            "reverse" VList or RVList, in which the end of the list (index Count-1) is 
            the natural location for adding items. To achieve this, the RVList sees
            the same elements as a FVList, but in reverse order.
            <para/>
            FWList and RWList are the names I picked for the mutable (Writable) 
            variants of FVList and RVList.
            <para/>
            A persistent list is a list that is normally considered immutable, so
            adding an item implies creating a new list rather than changing the one
            you've got. This is fast because persistent lists have a sort of
            copy-on-write semantics, so that "copying" a list is a trivial O(1)
            operation, but modifying a list is sometimes quite inefficient. My 
            implementation of VLists presents a mutable IList(of T) interface, but 
            this is only to adhere to .NET Framework conventions. FVList and RVList 
            are value types that update their own references to the list when they are 
            modified. Thus, "Copying" a list is done with a simple assignment 
            statement. For example:
            <code lang="C#">
            RVList&lt;int&gt; a = new RVList&lt;int&gt;(), b = new RVList&lt;int&gt;();
            a.Add(1);
            a.Add(2);
            b = a;             // copy the list
            a.Add(3);          // a[0] is 1, a[1] is 2, a[2] is 3
            b.Add(97);         // b[0] is 1, b[1] is 2, b[2] is 97
            </code>
            Traditionally, this kind of behavior was accomplished with singly-linked
            lists, but FVList does it with (in essence) a singly-linked list of arrays
            and thereby saves memory while allowing some operations to be done faster
            than they were done with linked lists. In pathological cases, however, FVList
            can use much more memory than a linked list and degenerate so that its
            performance characteristics are almost as bad as a linked list. One major 
            problem that comes to mind is if you keep changing the last item:
            <code lang="C#">
            RVList&lt;int&gt; list = new RVList&lt;int&gt;();
            ... add some items to list ...
            for(int n;; n++)
                list[list.Count-1] = n;
            </code>
            Unlike, for example, a C++-based FVList implementation, it is impossible for
            the FVList or RVList, which are value types, to know if the list has been 
            "copied" or not. In case the list has been copied, changing any element 
            requires a copy to be made of the VListBlock that contains that element, as 
            well as any subsequent blocks (in this example, only the last block must be 
            copied). Thus, the above example produces a lot of garbage very quickly; in 
            fact the rate of garbage production is (very roughly) proportional to the 
            list length. The performance will be equally bad if you repeatedly remove 
            the last item and then re-add it.
            <para/>
            Since this kind of problem tends to get worse as the list gets larger, Phil
            Bagwell proposed using a two- or three-dimentional list arrangement so that
            no single block could exceed a certain size. I have not implemented that
            suggestion due to lack of free time and because I did not understand the
            details of his suggested implementation, but I have placed a size limit of
            1024 elements on any given block. Unfortunately, this means that some
            operations listed below degrade toward O(N) when the list is large, most 
            notably including the indexer, which requires over 1000 iterations to look 
            up element zero in an RVList that has one million elements.
            <para/>
            Due to the slow performance you get from operations like this, I decided 
            to implement FWList, a mutable version of the FVList, which I'll discuss 
            later.
            <para/>
            Similarly to a persistent linked list,
            <ul>
            <li>Adding an item to the front of a VList or the end of an RVList is always
              O(1) in time, and often O(1) in space (though, unlike a linked list, it
              may be much more)</li>
            <li>Removing an item from the front of a VList or the end of an RVList is 
              O(1) in time, although space not necessarily reclaimed.</li>
            <li>Adding or removing an item at the end of a VList or the front of an 
              RVList is O(N) and requires making a copy of the entire list.</li>
            <li>Inserting or removing a list of M items at the end of a VList or the 
              front of an RVList is O(N + M).</li>
            <li>Changing an item at an arbitrary position should be avoided, as it
              performs as poorly as inserting or removing an item at that position.</li>
            </ul>
            VLists, however, offer some operations that singly-linked lists cannot 
            provide efficiently:
            <ul>
            <li>Access by index averages O(1) in ideal conditions</li>
            <li>Getting the list length is typically O(log N), but O(1) in my version</li>
            <li>If a sublist points somewhere within a larger list, its index within the
              larger list can be obtained in between O(1) and O(log N) time.
              Consequently, reverse enumeration is possible without creating a 
              temporary stack or list.</li>
            </ul>
            Also, VLists can (in the best cases) store data almost as compactly as
            ordinary arrays.
            <para/>
            I suspect FVList(of T) and RVList(of T) almost always outperforms 
            LinkedList(of T) in both time and space, if you are always adding and
            removing items at the correct end of the list. And it should perform as 
            well as List(of T) in some situations while providing an illusion of 
            immutability that List(of T) can't. For lists of 0 to 2 items, FVList and 
            RVList use less space than List(of T) (in fact, no object is allocated 
            for an empty FVList or RVList.)
            <para/>
            The FWList is built on the same foundation as the FVList (a linked list of
            VListBlock objects whose size increases exponentially), but it allows 
            you to modify the list just like List&lt;T&gt;. FWList is a hybrid 
            mutable-immutable data structure: a single list can be partly mutable 
            and partly immutable. More specifically, a FWList is conceptually divided 
            into two "halves": the front half is mutable, and the tail half is 
            immutable. The two halves need not be the same size (in fact, very often 
            one half is zero-size).
            <para/>
            Because some or all of a FWList can be immutable, a VList can be converted
            to a FWList, or vice versa, in typically O(log N) time. If you modify a 
            FWList after calling its ToFVList() method, a portion of the list is first 
            copied into a mutable block and then modified, and this copy operation 
            typically takes O(N) time.
            <para/>
            RWList is like FWList except that new items are added at index Count 
            instead of index zero. The head of a FWList is at index 0 and is returned 
            from the First property; the head of an RWList is at index Count-1 and is
            returned from the Last property.
            <para/>
            VListBlock implements a single "node" or "sub-array" within a VList. It
            contains a fixed-size array. When adding a new item to a VListBlock that
            is already full, a new empty VListBlock is created (with a larger array),
            whose _prior reference points to the old VListBlock. See Phil Bagwell's 
            paper (or Wikipedia) for details.
            <para/>
            VListBlock adds one new member to the structure Phil Bagwell described,
            PriorCount, a count of elements in other (smaller) lists to which this list
            is linked. This makes TotalCount an O(1) operation instead of O(log N),
            which is necessary so that RVList[i] and RWList[i] are O(1) on average.
            <para/>
            Independent instances of FVList, RVList, FWList and RWList can be accessed 
            from independent threads even though they may share some of the same 
            memory. Individual instances of these objects, however, are not 
            synchronized.
            <para/>
            A few LINQ-style methods like Select and Where are implemented on the four 
            data structures. These are provided to optimize functional code that takes 
            an input list and produces an output list, but might not actually change 
            the list. If all, or the tail, of the output is the same as the output,
            then the output list will share memory with the input list.
            <para/>
            Note that unlike LINQ methods, these methods are greedy. They perform the 
            requested operation immediately, not as-needed.

        <member name="F:Loyc.Collections.VListBlock`1._immCount">
            <summary>number of immutable elements in our local array, plus a 
            "mutable" flag in bit 30.</summary>
            <remarks>Aside from the mutable flag, this value only increases, 
            never decreases.
            <para/>
            If the some or all of the block is mutable, _immCount bit 30 is set 
            (0x40000000), and the low bits contain the number of immutable items.
            In that case the total number of items in use, including mutable 
            items, is only known by the FWList or RWList that encapsulates the 
            block.
            <para/>
            The mutable flag is part of this field instead of being a separate 
            flag for two reasons: 
            (1) Saving space. A separate boolean would enlarge the object 4 bytes.
            (2) High-performance thread safety. Instead of using locks, I use 
                interlocked changes to obtain thread safety.
            <para/>
            I don't know how fast or slow .NET locking is, but I assume you can't
            get faster than a single Interlocked.CompareExchange, so I have 
            designed thread safety around _immCount.
            <para/>
            I hate trying to guarantee thread safety because I don't know how to 
            prove correctness. I know that thread safety must be considered for 
            at least the following operations:
            <ul>
            <li>Adding an item at the end of an immutable VListBlock: two VLists 
            on different threads may try to add an item to the "front" of the same 
            block at the same time.</li>
            <li>Reserving mutable items in a list: two threads may do this at once, 
            or an immutable VList may add an item at the same instant.</li>
            </ul>
            Interlocked.CompareExchange() is used in both cases, which ensures 
            that only one thread succeeds and any threads that fail do not alter 
            the value of the field.
            <para/>
            A mutable block can be made immutable again by clearing bit 30. No
            interlocked exchange is required for this, since any thread that 
            notices bit 30 is set will not attempt to modify this field in the 
            first place.
            <para/>
            We need not worry about thread safety in order to obtain the immutable
            tail of a list (or equivalently, to remove items from the "front") 
            because that operation doesn't make use of this field (Remember, each 
            instance of VList has its own private _localCount.) Nor do we need to 
            worry about enumerating or modifying an immutable list (the latter is 
            just an illusion, after all). 
            <para/>
            I have not concerned myself with thread safety when a single VList 
            instance (whether mutable or immutable) is accessed from multiple 
            threads, because doing so is not supported. It occurs to me, however, 
            that there could be security concerns if untrusted code is given 
            access to any kind of VList; e.g. perhaps malicious code could 
            corrupt a VListBlock somehow by exploiting lack of thread safety.
            <para/>
            Theoretically you shouldn't modify an FWList/RWList while it is being
            enumerated, but the danger is limited to an incorrect sequence of 
            items being returned from the enumerator; a "subList is not within 
            list" exception is also possible.
            <para/>
            Important things to note: 
            (1) once items are switched from mutable to immutable, they can never 
                be made mutable again, since there is no way to know if any 
                immutable VList references still exist.
            (2) mutable items always belong to exactly one FWList or one RWList,
                but a VListBlock doesn't know what FWList it belongs to. A FWList 
                or RWList is detached from its VListBlock when Clear() is called,
                making the block immutable again.
            (3) if not all the items in a VListBlock are mutable, then the Prior 
                list is guaranteed to be immutable. In other words, mutable and 
                immutable items are not interleaved; mutable items are always at 
                the "front" and immutable items are always at the "back" (which
                is the beginning of an RVList or end of an FVList).
            (4) When the mutable flag is set, _immCount appears to be a very 
                large number. Code that uses _immCount directly instead of 
                calling ImmCount is taking advantage of that fact.

            This method helps write functional code in which you process an input 
            list and produce an output list that may or may not be the same as the 
            input list. In case the output list is identical, you would prefer
            to return the original input list rather than wasting memory on a new 
            list. SmartAdd() helps you do this. The following method demonstrates
            SmartAdd() by removing all negative numbers from a list:
            <example>
            FVList&lt;int&gt; RemoveNegative(FVList&lt;int&gt; input)
            {
                var output = FVList&lt;int&gt;.Empty;
                // Enumerate tail-to-head
                foreach (int n in (RVList&lt;int&gt;)input)
                    if (n >= 0)
                        output.SmartAdd(n, input);
                return output;
            }
            </example>
            You could also do the same thing with input.Filter(delegate(int i) { return i; } >= 0)

            <remarks>
            This is my attempt to make an optimized multi-purpose routine for
            transforming a FVList or RVList. It is slightly cumbersome to use,
            but allows you to do several common operations in one transformer
            method.
            <para/>
            The VListTransformer method takes two arguments: an item and its index 
            in the FVList or RVList. It can modify the item if desired, and then it
            returns a XfAction value, which indicates the action to take. Most
            often you will return XfAction.Drop, XfAction.Keep, XfAction.Change, 
            which, repectively, drop the item from the output list, copy the item 
            to the output list unchanged (even if you modified the item), and 
            copy the item to the output list (assuming you changed it).
            <para/>
            Transform() needs to know if the item changed, at least at first,
            because if the first items are kept without changes, then the output
            list can share a common tail with the input list. If the transformer
            method returns XfAction.Keep for every element, then the output list
            is exactly the same (operator== returns true).
            <para/>
            Of course, it would have been simpler just to return a boolean
            indicating whether to keep the item, and the Transform method itself 
            could check whether the item changed. But checking for equality is
            a tad slow in the .NET framework, because there is no bitwise 
            equality operator in .NET, so a virtual function would have to be 
            called instead to test equality, which is especially slow if T is a 
            value type that does not implement IEquatable(of T).
            <para/>
            The final possible action, XfAction.Repeat, is like XfAction.Change 
            except that Transform() calls the VListTransformer again. The second 
            call has the form x(~i, ref item), where ~i is the bitwise NOT of the 
            index i, and item is the same item that x returned the first time it 
            was called. On the second call, x() can return XfAction.Change again 
            to get a third call, if it wants.
            <para/>
            XfAction.Repeat is best explained by example. In the following
            examples, assume "list" is an RVList holding the numbers (1, 2, 3):
            <example>
            output = list.Transform((i, ref n) => {
                // This example produces (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3)
                return i >= 0 ? XfAction.Repeat : XfAction.Keep;
            });
            
            output = list.Transform((i, ref n) => {
                // This example produces (1, 10, 2, 20, 3, 30)
                if (i >= 0) 
                    return XfAction.Repeat;
                n *= 10;
                return XfAction.Change;
            });
            
            output = list.Transform((i, ref n) => {
                // This example produces (10, 1, 20, 2, 30, 3)
                if (i >= 0) {
                    n *= 10;
                    return XfAction.Repeat;
                }
                return XfAction.Keep;
            });
            
            output = list.Transform((i, ref n) => {
                // This example produces (10, 100, 1000, 20, 200, 30, 300)
                n *= 10;
                if (n > 1000)
                    return XfAction.Drop;
                return XfAction.Repeat;
            });
            </example>
            And now for some examples using XfAction.Keep, XfAction.Drop and
            XfAction.Change. Assume list is an RVList holding the following 
            integers: (-1, 2, -2, 13, 5, 8, 9)
            <example>
            output = list.Transform((i, ref n) =>
            {   // Keep every second item: (2, 13, 8)
                return (i % 2) == 1 ? XfAction.Keep : XfAction.Drop;
            });
            
            output = list.Transform((i, ref n) =>
            {   // Keep odd numbers: (-1, 13, 5, 9)
                return (n % 2) != 0 ? XfAction.Keep : XfAction.Drop;
            });
            
            output = list.Transform((i, ref n) =>
            {   // Keep and square all odd numbers: (1, 169, 25, 81)
                if ((n % 2) != 0) {
                    n *= n;
                    return XfAction.Change;
                } else
                    return XfAction.Drop;
            });
            
            output = list.Transform((i, ref n) =>
            {   // Increase each item by its index: (-1, 3, 0, 16, 9, 13, 15)
                n += i;
                return i == 0 ? XfAction.Keep : XfAction.Change;
            });
            </example>

            Sparse nodes are "reorganized" when they run out of free space, when
            Count reaches MaxCount, or when the number of values reaches 32.
            <para/>
            Well, actually if we run out of free space we can either reorganize, or
            allocate more space, unless the number of cells reaches MaxCells.
            <para/>
            Another problem that this method must address is what to do if there are
            enough free cells, but the cell at _count is in use. This problem only 
            occurs if there is fragmentation in the free cell list.  In that case an
            O(_count+_extraCellsUsed) scan would be needed to find who is using the 
            cell and relocate it, but it's easier (and not much slower) just to do 
            the same compaction process that is done when enlarging _cells.
            <para/>
            Compaction moves all free cells to the middle of the array, which helps
            ensure that when _count needs to increase, _cells[_count] is free.
            <para/>
            There are two "reorganizing" options:
            1. Create a child node to free up space (can be done repeatedly)
            2. Convert this node to a JPBitmap node (TODO)

            <remarks>
            <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1"/> is a dual-mode mutable/immutable "hash trie",
            which is a kind of tree that is built from the hashcode of the items it 
            contains. It supports fast cloning, and is suitable as a persistent data
            structure.
            <para/>
            InternalSet&lt;T&gt; is not designed to be used by itself, but as a building
            block for other data structures. It has no Count property because it does 
            not know its own size; the outer data structure must track the size if 
            the size is needed. The lack of a Count property allows an empty 
            InternalSet to use a mere single word of memory!
            <para/>
            This is my second implementation of InternalSet. The original version
            used memory very efficiently for reference types, but required boxing for
            value types; this version needs more memory, but is moderately faster in
            most cases and supports value types without boxing. I estimate that 
            InternalSet (the second version) uses roughly the same amount of memory as 
            <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.HashSet`1"/> (actually more or less depending on the number of 
            items in the set, and on the hashcode distribution.)
            <para/>
            Collection classes based on InternalSet are most efficient for small sets,
            but if you always need small sets then a simple wrapper around HashSet 
            would suffice. In fact, despite my best efforts, this data type rarely 
            outperforms HashSet, but this is because <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.HashSet`1"/> is quite
            fast, not because <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1"/> is slow. Still, there are
            several reasons to consider using a collection class based on InternalSet
            instead of <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.HashSet`1"/>:
            <ul>
            <li>All of my set collections offer read-only variants. You can instantly 
            convert any mutable set or dictionary into an immutable one, and convert 
            any immutable set or dictionary back into a mutable one in O(1) time; 
            this relies on the same fast-cloning technique I developed for 
            <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.AList`1"/>*.</li>
            <li>All of my set collections offer set operators that combine or intersect
            two sets without modifying the source sets ("|" for union, "&amp;" for
            intersection, "-" for subtraction); these operators are available on both
            the mutable and immutable versions of the sets.</li>
            <li><see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1"/> supports combined "get-and-replace" and 
            "get-and-remove" operations, which is mainly useful when it is being used
            as a dictionary (i.e. when T is a key-value pair). There are two "Add" 
            modes, "add if not present" and "add or replace"; both modes retrieve the 
            existing value if the key was already present, and the "add or replace" 
            mode furthermore changes the value. Also, when removing an item, you can
            get the value that was removed.</li>
            <li><see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1"/>'s enumerator allows you to change or
            delete the current value (this feature is used internally by set operations
            such as <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1.UnionWith(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{`0},System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer{`0},System.Boolean)"/> and <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1.IntersectWith(Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet{`0},System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer{`0})"/>).</li>
            <li><see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1"/> was inspired by Clojure's PersistentHashMap,
            or rather by Karl Krukow's blog posts about PersistentHashMap**, and so it
            is designed so that you can use it as a fully persistent set, which means
            that you can keep a copy of every old version of the set that has ever 
            existed, if you want. The "+" and "-" operators (provided on the wrapper 
            classes, not on <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1"/> itself) allow you to add or 
            remove a single item without modifying the original set. There is a 
            substantial performance penalty for overusing these operators, but these
            operators are cheaper than duplicating a <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.HashSet`1"/> every 
            time you modify it.</li>
            </ul>
            * After developing <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.AList`1"/> and Loyc trees, I realized that
              freezable classes are error-prone, because it is sometimes difficult for
              a developer to figure out (before run-time) whether a given object could
              be frozen. If an object is frozen and you modify it, the compiler will
              never detect your mistake in advance and warn you. The collections based 
              on <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1"/> fix this problem by having separate data 
              types for frozen and unfrozen (a.k.a. immutable and mutable) collections.<br/>

            <para/>
            InternalSet is not efficient for Ts that are expensive to compare; unlike 
            standard .NET collections, this data structure does not store the hashcode 
            of each item inside the collection. The memory saved by not storing the 
            hashcode compensates for the extra memory that <c>InternalSet</c> tends to 
            require due to its structure.
            <para/>
            As I was saying, this data structure is inspired by Clojure's 
            PersistentHashMap. Whereas PersistentHashMap uses nodes of size 32, I chose 
            to use nodes of size 16 in order to increase space efficiency for small 
            sets; for some reason I tend to design programs that use many small 
            collections and a few big ones, so I tend to prefer designs that stay 
            efficient at small sizes.
            <para/>
            So InternalSet is a tree of nodes, with each level of the tree 
            representing 4 bits of the hashcode. Slots in the root node are selected
            based on bits 0 to 3 of the hashcode, slots in children of the root are
            selected based on bits 4 to 7 of the hashcode, and so forth. Here's a 
            diagram:
            <pre>
                                         _root*
            * IsFrozen=true                |
                                           |
                  +---------+---------+----+----+---------+---------+
                  |         |         |         |         |         |
                 0x2       0x3       0x6       0x7       0x9       0xF
                            |                   |         |
                         +--+--+                |      +--+--+
                         |     |                |      |     |
                       0x13   0x73             0x57  0x09   0x59
            </pre>
            Each of the 12 nodes on this diagram has 16 slots for items of type T, and 
            the 4 nodes that have children have 16 additional slots for references to 
            children. The numbers on the nodes represent their role in the tree; for 
            example:
            <ul>
            <li>0x59 is at depth 2 and only holds items whose hashcodes end with 0x59.</li>
            <li>0x9 is at depth 1 and only holds items whose hashcodes end with 0x9.  </li>
            <li>the root node is always at depth 0 and can hold any item regardless of 
                hashcode.</li> 
            </ul>
            <para/>
            Technically, this data structure has O(log N) time complexity for search,
            insertion and removal. However, it's a base-16 logarithm and maxes out at
            8 levels, so it is faster than typical O(log N) algorithms that are 
            base-2. At smaller sizes, its speed is similar to a conventional hashtable,
            and some operations are still efficient at large sizes, too.
            <para/>
            Unlike <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalList`1"/>, <c>new InternalSet&lt;T&gt;()</c> is a 
            valid empty set. Moreover, because the root node is never changed after
            it is created (unless you modify it while it is frozen), all copies of
            an <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1"/> represent the same set unless the set is
            frozen with <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1.CloneFreeze"/>; see <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1.Thaw"/> for more
            information.
            <para/>
            The neatest feature of this data structure is fast cloning and subtree 
            sharing. You can call <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1.CloneFreeze"/> to freeze/clone the trie 
            in O(1) time; this freezes the root node (a transitive property that 
            implicitly affects all children), but still permits the hashtrie to be 
            modified by copying nodes on-demand. Thus the trie is actually frozen, but 
            copy-on-write behavior provides the illusion that it is still editable.
            <para/>
            This data structure is designed to support classes that contain mutable
            data, so that it can be used to construct dictionaries; that is, it allows
            T values that have an immutable "key" part and a mutable "value" part.
            Call <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1.Find(`0@,System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer{`0})"/> to retrieve the value associated with a key, and
            call <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1.Add(`0@,System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer{`0},System.Boolean)"/> with replaceIfPresent=true to change the "value" 
            associated with a key. The <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Map`2"/> and <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.MMap`2"/> 
            classes rely on this feature to implement a dictionary.
            <para/>
            <b>How it works</b>: I call this data structure a "hash-trie" because it
            blends properties of hashtables and tries. It places items into a tree 
            by taking their hashcode and dividing it into 8 groups of 4 bits, starting 
            at the least significant bits. Each group of 4 bits is used to select a
            location in the tree/trie, and each node of the tree always has 16 items
            (and 16 children, if it has any children at all.) For example, consider a 
            tree with 7 items that have the following hash codes:
            <para/>
            - J: 0x89BC98B1 <br/>
            - K: 0xB173A12C <br/>
            - L: 0x20913491 <br/>
            - M: 0x1977FEB3 <br/>
            - N: 0x01299451 <br/>
            - O: 0x0732AF01 <br/>
            - P: 0x0732AF01 (Note: O.Equals(P)==false, but the hashcodes are equal)
            <para/>
            The top level of the trie represents the lowest 4 bits of the hashcode.
            Since each node has 16 items, 7 items can usually fit in a single node, 
            but in this case there are too many hashcodes that end with "1", causing
            a node split:
            <pre>
                                       |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|A|B|C|D|E|F|
                   _root ==&gt; _items    | |!|!|M|!| | | | | | | |K| | | |
                             _children | |*| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
                             
                                       |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|A|B|C|D|E|F|
            * child node ==&gt; _items    |O|P| | | |N| | | |L| |J| | | | |
                             _children (null)
                             
            ("!" represents the deleted flag, which indicates that an item was 
             once present at this location.)
            </pre>
            The second level of the trie represents bits 4-7, which is the second-
            last hex digit. You can see, for example, that the second-last digit of 
            N is 5, therefore N is stored at index 5 of the child node.
            <para/>
            In case hashcodes of different objects collide at a particular digit,
            adjacent array elements can be used to hold the different objects that
            share the same 4-bit sub-hashcode; this is a bounded-time variation on 
            the linearly-probed hashtable. In this example, both O and P have 
            zero as their second-last digit. Assuming O is added first, it takes
            slot [0]; then P takes slot [1]. Up to 3 adjacent entries can be used
            for a given hashcode; therefore, when searching for an entry it is 
            necessary to search up to 4 locations in each node: the preferred 
            location, plus 3 adjacent locations.
            <para/>
            For example, support we search for an item X that is not in the set
            and has hashcode 0xCCA9A241. In that case, the Find methods starts with 
            the least-significant digit, 1. This points us to the child slot; an 
            invariant of our hashtrie is that if there is a child node, all items 
            with the corresponding sub-hashcode must be placed in the child node. 
            Therefore it is impossible, for example, that X could be located at 
            index 2 of the root node; the existence of the child node guarantees
            that it is not there. So the Find method looks inside the child node,
            at index 4 (the second-last digit of X's hashcode) and finds nothing.
            It also looks at indexes 5, 6, and 7, comparing N to X in the process.
            Since none of these slots contain X, the Find method returns false.
            <para/>
            Something unfortunate happens if five or more objects have the same 
            hashcode: it forces the tree to have maximum depth. Since a particular
            hashcode can only be repeated four times in a single node, upon adding
            a fifth item with the same hashcode, child nodes are created for all
            8 digits of the hashcode. At the 8th level, a special node type is 
            allocated that contains, in addition to the usual 16 slots, a list of
            "overflow slots" holds items that cannot fit in the normal slots due
            to excessive collisions. All of this has a substantial memory penalty;
            to avoid this problem, use a better hash function that does not create 
            false collisions.
            <para/>
            If there are more than 16 items that share the same 28 lower-order 
            bits, the overflow area on the 8th level node will expand to hold all 
            of these items; this is the only way that a node can have more than 
            16 items.
            <para/>
            Fast cloning works by setting the "IsFrozen" flag on the root node.
            When a node is frozen, all its children are frozen implicitly; since 
            the children are not marked right away, the <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1.CloneFreeze"/>
            method can return immediately. The frozen flag will be propagated from 
            parents to children lazily, when the tree is modified later.
            <para/>
            To "thaw" a node, a copy is made of that node and all of its parents.
            For example, suppose that the following tree is frozen and cloned:
            <pre>
                                         _root*
            * IsFrozen=true                |
                                           |
                  +---------+---------+----+----+---------+---------+
                  |         |         |         |         |         |
                 0x2       0x3       0x6       0x7       0x9       0xF
                            |                   |         |
                         +--+--+                |      +--+--+
                         |     |                |      |     |
                       0x13   0x73             0x57  0x09   0x59
            </pre>
            Remember, only the root's IsFrozen flag is set at first; all other nodes
            do not have the frozen flag yet.
            <para/>
            Now suppose that an item is added to node 0x9 (e.g. something with hashcode 
            0x39 could go in this node). Before the new item can be placed in node 0x9, 
            it must be thawed. To thaw it, an unfrozen copy is made, leaving the 
            original untouched. The copy is not frozen, but it does point to the same 
            frozen children (0x09 and 0x59), so a for-loop sets the IsFrozen flag of 
            each child. Then, the new item is added to the copy of node 0x9. Next, the 
            _root is also unfrozen by making a copy of it with <c>IsFrozen=false</c>. 
            Again, a for-loop sets the IsFrozen flag of each frozen child, and then 
            child slot [9] in the root is replaced with the new copy of 0x9 (which has 
            the new item).
            <para/>
            This concludes the thawing process. So at this point, just two nodes are
            actually unfrozen, and the modified tree looks like this:
            <pre>
            ! Unfrozen copy              _root!
            * IsFrozen=true                |
                                           |
                  +---------+---------+----+----+---------+---------+
                  |         |         |         |         |         |
                 0x2*      0x3*      0x6*      0x7*      0x9!      0xF*
                            |                   |         |
                         +--+--+                |      +--+--+
                         |     |                |      |     |
                       0x13   0x73             0x57  0x09*  0x59*
            </pre>
            There are 12 nodes here and 2 have been copied. The other 10 nodes are 
            still shared between the modified tree and the clone. Next, if you add an
            item to node 0x6, only that one node has to be thawed; the root has already
            been thawed and there is no need to make another copy of it. Due to the 
            random nature of hashcodes, it is probable that as you modify the set after 
            cloning it, it is typical for each modification to require approximately
            one node to be thawed, until the majority of the nodes have been thawed.
            <para/>
            InternalSet does not thaw unnecessarily. If you try to remove an item that 
            is not present, none of the tree will be thawed. If you add an item that is 
            already present in a frozen node (and you do not ask for replacement), 
            that node will not be thawed. <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1.Contains(`0,System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer{`0})"/> and <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1.Find(`0@,System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer{`0})"/>
            never cause thawing.
            <para/>
            I am not aware whether a data structure quite like this has been described
            in the comp-sci literature or not (although it probably has). If you see 
            something like this in a paper, let me know.
            <para/>
            When attempting to insert a new item in a node, the first available empty 
            slot will be used; and when searching for an item, the search stops at an
            empty slot. For example, suppose that the root node contains these items:
            <pre>
                                |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|A|B|C|D|E|F|
            _root ==&gt; _items    |A| |C| |E|F| | |I| |K|L| |N| | |
            </pre>
            Now suppose that you are searching for, or adding, or an item 'D' whose 
            hashcode ends with '3'. Slot 3 is empty, and this data structure works
            in such a way that the search for 'D' can end immediately with a result 
            of 'false', or it can be added at slot 2 immediately without comparing
            'D' with slots 4, 5 and 6 which (if 2 were not empty) might already 
            contain 'D'.
            <para/>
            The reasoning behind this rule is that if 'D' already existed in the set, 
            slot 2 should not be empty; since it is empty, 'D' must not be in the set
            already. However, deletions could violate this logic. For example, imagine
            that we add two items, first 'd' and then 'D', which both have a hashcode 
            that ends in '3'. Then the node would look like this:
            <pre>
                                |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|A|B|C|D|E|F|
            _root ==&gt; _items    |A| |C|d|E|F|D| |I| |K|L| |N| | |
            </pre>
            Next, you delete 'd'. Imagine that this leaves the node in the following state:
            <pre>
                                |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|A|B|C|D|E|F|
            _root ==&gt; _items    |A| |C| |E|F|D| |I| |K|L| |N| | |
            </pre>
            Now 'D' is left outside its 'home' location of 3. If you then attempt to
            add 'D' to the set, a duplicate copy would be added at position '3'! Or if
            you search for 'D' instead, the result would be 'false' even though D is 
            present in the set.
            <para/>
            I thought of two solutions to this problem; the first was to 'fix' the node
            after a deletion so that 'D' would move from slot 6 to 3. But there's a big
            problem with this solution because <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1.Enumerator"/> 
            has a <c>RemoveCurrent()</c> method which is supposed to delete the current
            item and move to the next one. If the node had to be rearranged in response 
            to a deletion, it would be very difficult to guarantee that the enumerator 
            still returns each item in the set exactly once.
            <para/>
            The second solution, which I actually implemented, puts a special "deleted"
            marker in slot 3 (denoted ! on the first diagram). This marker forces the
            search routine to compare the item being added or searched for with other
            slots beyond the current one, but otherwise it behaves like an empty slot.
            <para/>
            There is a third solution--always check all four possible slots. But the
            comparison is not always cheap, so <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1"/> does not
            use this solution unless you are using <c>null</c> as the value of the 
            <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IEqualityComparer`1"/>.
            <para/>
            Since <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1"/> can hold any value of type T, the 
            "deleted" and "empty/in use" indicators cannot physically be stored in the 
            slots of type T. Instead, these indicators are stored separately, with 16 
            bits for "deleted" flags and 16 bits for "used" flags.
            <para/>
            During a normal delete operation, if a node has no children and is using 
            only one or two slots after an item is deleted, the parent is checked for 
            empty slots to find out whether the child is really necessary. If there are 
            enough free slot(s) in the parent node, the remaining items in the child 
            are transferred back back to the parent and the child is deleted (the 
            reference to it is cleared to null).
            <para/>
            Unfortunately, this behavior is not available when you call
            <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1.Enumerator.RemoveCurrent(Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet{`0}@)"/>. In order to maintain the integrity
            of the enumerator, a child node will not be deleted during a call to
            <c>RemoveCurrent</c> unless the node is completely empty after the removal.
            Consequently, the tree will use extra memory if you remove most, but not 
            all, items from the set using <c>RemoveCurrent</c>.
            <para/>
            By the way, unlike the original implementation, this version of InternalSet 
            allows 'null' to be a member of the set.
            <para/>
            Interesting fact: it is possible for two sets to be equal (contain the 
            same items), and yet for those items to be enumerated in different orders
            in the two sets.

            at least temporarily, which can produce strange results.
            <para/>
            It is mostly safe to copy InternalSet instances, however, because 
            they only contain a single piece of data (a reference to the root
            node), and the root node only changes in two situations:
            <ol>

            <li>When the root node is frozen and you modify the set or call this method</li>
            </ol>
            In the second case, when you have frozen a set with <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1.CloneFreeze"/>,
            all existing copies are frozen, and further changes affect only 
            the specific copy that you change. You can also call <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalSet`1.Thaw"/>
            if you need to make copies that are kept in sync, without 
            actually modifying the set first.
            <para/>
            This method has no effect if the root node is already thawed.

            Efficiency note: a normal Remove operation can delete a child node 
            when there are still two items left in the child (the items can be
            transferred to the parent node). RemoveCurrent, however, only 
            deletes child nodes that become completely empty, because it would 
            be very difficult to implement MoveNext() correctly (meaning, it
            would be very difficult to enumerate every item exactly once) if 
            the tree were "rebalanced" like this during enumeration.
            <para/>
            Therefore, in rare cases, a set whose size decreases via this 
            method will use significantly more memory than necessary. And in
            general, adding new items later will not re-use the mostly-empty 
            nodes unless the new items used to be in the set (or have similar
            hashcodes).

            <ul>
            <li>MMap allows null as a key (assuming it is based on the second version

            there is a null key in the collection.</li>

            <li>This class has an <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.MMap`2.AddRange(Loyc.Collections.MMap{`0,`1},System.Boolean)"/> method.</li>

            returns a default value if the key is not present; <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.MMap`2.AddIfNotPresent(`0,`1)"/>

            combine two dictionaries to create a new dictionary, without modifying

            <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.MMap`2.With(`0,`1,System.Boolean)"/> and <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.MMap`2.Without(`0)"/> create a new dictionary

            safely be initialized to 0 or null, its default value is a valid set and

            but <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Map`2"/> contains a set of type

            type <c>IEqualityComparer&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;K,V&gt;&gt;</c>. In general, a 
            wrapper object is necessary to provide this comparer, and I decided to use
            the set itself as the wrapper object. Therefore, <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Map`2"/> 
            implements this interface, and it must be a class so that it is not boxed
            every time it is converted to this interface.

            Finally, since <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Map`2"/> and <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.MMap`2"/> are both 
            classes and share some of the same code, I decided to factor out the 
            common code into this base class. The end.

            An <a href="http://core.loyc.net/collections/alists-part1.html">article</a>
            about this class is available.
            <para/>
            <typeparam name="T">Type of each element in the list</typeparam>
            <remarks>
            The name "A-List" is short for All-purpose List. It is so named because
            it has a very large amount of functionality and extension points for 
            further extending this functionality. Essentially, this data structure
            is jack-of-all-trades, master of none.
            <para/>
            Structurally, ALists (like BLists) are very similar to B+trees. They use
            memory almost as efficiently as arrays, and offer O(log N) insertion and
            deletion in exchange for a O(log N) indexer, which is distinctly slower 
            than the indexer of <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.List`1"/>. They use slightly more memory 
            than <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.List`1"/> for all list sizes.
            <para/>
            That said, you should use an AList whenever you know that the list might be 
            large and need insertions or deletions somewhere in the middle. If you 
            expect to do insertions and deletions at random locations, but only 
            occasionally, <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.DList`1"/> is sometimes a better choice because 
            it has a faster indexer. Both classes provide fast enumeration (O(1) per 
            element), but <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.DList`1"/> enumerators initialize faster.
            <para/>
            Although AList isn't the fastest or smallest data structure for any 
            single task, it is very useful when you need several different 
            capabilities, and there are certain tasks for which it excels; for 
            example, have you ever wanted to remove all items that meet certain 
            criteria from a list? You cannot accomplish this with a foreach loop 
            such as this:
            <para/>
            foreach (T item in list)
               if (MeetsCriteria(item))
                  list.Remove(item);
                  // Exception occurs! foreach loop cannot continue after Remove()!
            <para/>
            When you are using a <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.List`1"/>, you might try to solve this 
            problem with a reverse for-loop such as this:
            <para/>
            for (int i = list.Count - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--)
               if (MeetsCriteria(list[i]))
                  list.RemoveAt(i);
            <para/>
            This works, but it runs in O(N^2) time, so it's very slow if the list is 
            large. The easiest way to solve this problem that is also efficient is to 
            duplicate all the items that you want to keep in a new list:
            <para/>
            var list2 = new List&lt;T&gt;();
            foreach (T item in list)
               if (!MeetsCriteria(item))
                  list2.Add(item);
            list = list2;
            <para/>
            But what if you didn't think of that solution and already wrote the O(N^2)
            version? There's a lot of code out there already that relies on slow 
            <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.List`1"/> operations. An easy way to solve performance caused
            by poor use of <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.List`1"/> is simply to add "A" in front. AList
            is pretty much a drop-in replacement for List, so you can convert O(N^2) 
            into faster O(N log N) code simply by using an AList instead of a List.
            <para/>
            I like to think of AList as the ultimate novice data structure. Novices
            like indexed lists, although for many tasks they are not the most efficient
            choice. AList isn't optimized for any particular task, but it isn't 
            downright slow for any task except <c>IndexOf</c>, so it's very 
            friendly to novices that don't know about all the different types of data
            structures and how to choose one. Don't worry about it! Just pick AList.
            It's also a good choice when you're just too busy to think about 
            performance, such as in a scripting environment.
            <para/>
            Plus, you can subscribe to the <see cref="E:Loyc.Collections.AListBase`2.ListChanging"/> 
            event to find out when the list changes. AList's observability is more 
            lightweight than that of ObservableCollection{T}.
            <para/>
            Although single insertions, deletions, and random access require O(log N)
            time, you can get better performance using any overload of 
            <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.AList`1.InsertRange(System.Int32,Loyc.Collections.AList{`0})"/> or <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.AListBase`2.RemoveRange(System.Int32,System.Int32)"/>.
            These methods require only O(log N + M) time, where M is the number of 
            elements you are inserting, removing or enumerating.
            <para/>
            AList is an excellent choice if you need to make occasional snapshots of
            the tree. Cloning is fast and memory-efficient, because none of the tree
            is copied at first. The root node is simply marked as frozen, and nodes 
            are duplicated on-demand as changes are made. Thus, AList can be used as a 
            so-called "persistent" data structure, but it is fairly expensive to clone 
            the tree after every modification. When modifying a tree that was just 
            cloned (remember, AList is really a tree), the leaf node being changed and 
            all of its ancestors must be duplicated. Therefore, it's better if you can 
            arrange to have a high ratio of changes to clones.
            <para/>
            AList is also freezable, which is useful if you need to construct a list 
            in a read-only or freezable data structure. You could also freeze the list
            in order to return a read-only copy of it, which, compared to cloning, has 
            the advantage that no memory allocation is required at the time you return 
            the list. If you need to edit the list later, you can clone the list (the 
            clone can be modified).
            <para/>
            As explained in the documentation of <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.AListBase`1"/>, this class
            is NOT multithread-safe. Multiple concurrent readers are allowed, as long 
            as the collection is not modified, so frozen instances ARE multithread-safe.

            <typeparam name="T"></typeparam>
            <remarks>
            SimpleCache is not thread safe. However, G.Cache() is.
            <para/>
            SimpleCache is used simply by calling Cache(). For example, if C is a 
            SimpleCache(of string), then C.Cache("Hello") adds the string "Hello" to 
            the cache if it is not present already, or returns the existing string if 
            it is.
            <para/>
            I'll describe SimpleCache as a two-way set associative hash cache. An object 
            O with some hashcode X is always located at one of two locations in the 
            cache: X%S or (X+1)%S, where S is the size of the hashtable. If C.Cache(O) 
            is called and O is not in the cache, O is always placed at position X%S. 
            If another object P with hash Y is added, and Y%S == X%S, then O is moved 
            to position (X+1)%S so that P can take the position. Thus, an object is only
            located in the "plus one" position if it was less recently used, and the 
            cache will choose to discard that object when necessary.
            <para/>
            The cache size doubles when the number of objects discarded (replacements) 
            reaches the cache size, provided that the cache is at least 50% used. The 
            initial size is normally 32, and the maximum size can be specified in the 
            constructor (default: 1024). Note that regardless of cache size, it is 
            impossible for three objects to be in the cache at the same time if they
            all share the same hash code. But on the plus side, if you alternate between 
            calling Cache(A) and Cache(B), for any A and B, you are guaranteed to get 
            only cache hits in steady-state. (To prove this, by the way, one must 
            consider not only when A and B have the same hash code, but when 
            A.GetHashCode() == B.GetHashCode() + 1).
            <para/>
            The algorithm is pretty simple--Cache() has no loops--so it should be quite 
            fast as well.

            <remarks>
            This data type helps you solve the performance problem with using "yield
            return" recursively.
            <para/>
            To illustrate the problem, let's consider the case of binary tree traversal. 
            Suppose you define this data structure to hold a subtree of a sorted binary 
            tree of strings:
            <code>
            internal class StringNode : IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;
            {
                internal StringNode LeftChild;
                internal string Value;
                internal StringNode RightChild;
            }
            </code>
            You want to write an enumerator that returns all the strings in order.
            So you add this method to the StringNode class:
            <code>
            public IEnumerator&lt;string&gt; GetEnumerator()
            {
            	foreach(string item in LeftChild)
            		yield return item;
            	yield return Value;
            	foreach(string item in RightChild)
            		yield return item;
            }
            </code>
            As explained in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3969963/when-not-to-use-yield-return">
            this web page</a>, this implementation will be slow, and it will get slower 
            and slower as the tree gets deeper.
            <para/>
            <see cref="T:Loyc.Utilities.Co`1"/> (Co is short for "coroutine") helps to solve this 
            problem with a postprocessing stage. Instead of writing GetEnumerator()
            directly as above, you write it like this instead:
            <code>
            public IEnumerator&lt;string&gt; GetEnumerator()
            {
            	return CoGetEnumerator().Unwrap();
            }
            public IEnumerator&lt;Co&lt;string&gt;&gt; CoGetEnumerator()
            {
            	yield return LeftChild.All();
            	yield return Value;
            	yield return RightChild.All();
            }
            </code>
            Simple, right? String is automatically converted to Co{string} so that you 
            can "yield return" one, but C# does not allow automatic coersion from 
            IEnumerator{Co{T}} to Co{T} so you must add the suffix <c>.All()</c> which
            really means "wrap the IEnumerator{Co{T}} into a Co{T} object".
            <para/>
            In fact, this class simulates the core functionality of C# 5's async/await 
            feature just using C# 2's iterators. However, the C# 5 async feature is 
            richer; for example, it supports exceptions properly. If an exception is
            thrown from within a nested iterator, the outer iterator is unable to catch
            the exception; it will be thrown directly into whatever foreach loop (or
            other code) that is enumerating the sequence.

            a way that is very easy to use. You should use <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.NestedEnumerator`2"/>
            instead if you need the highest possible performance.

            <para/>
            Often when people want to be able to associate multiple values with a 
            single key, they use a Dictionary with values of type <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.List`1"/>.
            This approach is very inefficient (in terms of memory use) if most keys are 
            only associated with one or two values; this class solves the problem using
            a single sorted B+ tree for all keys and all values. It requires, however,
            that both the keys and values are totally ordered (i.e. are sortable).
            <para/>
            By default, keys and values are sorted using <see cref="P:System.Collections.Generic.Comparer`1.Default"/>.
            This will work provided that the keys and values both implement the
            <see cref="T:System.IComparable`1"/> interface. If they don't, you can pass custom 
            comparison functions to the constructor instead (one comparison function for
            keys, and a second one for values).
            <para/>
            Since it is derived from <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.BList`1"/>, this class enjoys the space 
            efficiency of a B+ tree and capabilities of a <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.AListBase`2"/>,

            When you need a sorted list of items, there's nothing quite like a BList. BList offers
            numerous features that none of the standard .NET collections can offer:
            <ul>
            <li>O(log N) efficiency for all standard list operations (Add, Remove, 
            IndexOf, this[]) plus and O(1) fast cloning and O(1)-per-element enumeration.</li>
            <li>Changes can be observed through the <see cref="E:Loyc.Collections.AListBase`2.ListChanging"/> event.
            The performance penalty for this feature is lower than for the standard
            ObservableCollection{T} class.</li>
            <li>Changes to the tree structure can be observed too (see <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.IAListTreeObserver`2"/>).</li>
            <li>The list can be frozen with <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.AListBase`2.Freeze"/>, making it read-only.</li>
            <li><see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.BList`1.FindLowerBound(`0)"/> and <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.BList`1.FindUpperBound(`0)"/> operations
            that find the nearest item equal to or greater than a specified item.</li>
            <li>A reversed view of the list is available through the <see cref="P:Loyc.Collections.AListBase`2.ReverseView"/> 
            property, and the list can be enumerated backwards, also in O(1) time 
            per element.</li>.
            <li>A BList normally uses less memory than a <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.SortedDictionary`2"/> 
            or a hashtable such as <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.HashSet`1"/> or <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2"/>.</li>
            <li>Other features inherited from <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.AListBase`1"/></li>
            </ul>
            Please note, however, that <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.BList`1"/> is generally slower than
            <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2"/> and <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.HashSet`1"/>, so you should
            only use it when you need a sorted list of items, or when you need its
            special features such as <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.BList`1.FindLowerBound(`0)"/> or observability.
            <para/>
            Caution: items must not be modified in a way that affects their sort order 
            after they are added to the list. If the list ever stops being sorted, it
            will malfunction, as it will no longer be possible to find some of the 
            items.

            much memory as a plain <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.AList`1"/>. Moreover, changing the list 
            takes at least twice as much time, since the indexer must be updated to 
            reflect every change.
            <para/>
            An IndexedAList is indexed by default, but if necessary the index can be 
            disabled in the constructor or by settings the <see cref="P:Loyc.Collections.IndexedAList`1.IsIndexed"/> 
            property to false.

            <para/>
            The sparse A-List is implemented similarly to a normal A-List; the main 
            difference is that leaf nodes have a list of (int, T) pairs rather than
            a list of T values. The integers represent the relative index of each T
            value, as an offset from the beginning of the node. This allows an 
            arbitrary amount of empty space to exist between each T value in the
            list, making it sparse.
            <para/>
            <c>SparseAList</c> is a precise sparse list, meaning that you can rely on

             <summary>A bloom filter for very small sets.</summary>
             <remarks>
             Please see the following article for an introduction to the bloom filter:
             
             http://www.devsource.com/c/a/Languages/Bloom-Filters-in-C/
             
             This bloom filter's parameters are m=64 and k=2, so it contains just a
             single long value. If item hashes are random, the false positive rate (p)
             is under 5% if the set contains no more than 8 items, and under 10% if the
             set holds no more than 12 items. This is according to the calculator at 
             
             http://www-static.cc.gatech.edu/~manolios/bloom-filters/calculator.html
            
             The two 6-bit hashes this filter uses are simply the lowest 12 bits of the
             hashcode.
             
             If this filter is used to hold Symbols, it should be noted that the IDs 
             are not random but sequentially allocated, so it is likely to have
             a different false positive rate. Tentatively, I believe the number of bits
             set will be higher, leading to a worse false positive rate on random
             membership tests; but when testing related inputs, the false positive rate
             should be lower than the worst case.
             
             In any case, this filter performs increasing poorly as the number of
             elements increases: at 40 items, p exceeds 50%.

            An sorted dictionary that is efficient for all operations and offers

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            An <a href="http://core.loyc.net/collections/alists-part2.html">article</a>
            about the BList classes is available.
            <para/>
            The keys must be comparable (ordered); if the type does not implement
            <c>IComparable</c> or <c>IComparable(T)</c>, you must provide a 
            Comparison(T) delegate to perform comparisons.
            <para/>
            This class offers the following additional features beyond what's offered 
            by the standard SortedDictionary{T} class: indexed access, a find-nearest-
            key operation called <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.BDictionary`2.FindLowerBound(`0)"/> (similar to lower_bound 
            in C++), observability, fast cloning, freezability, fast cloning of an 
            arbitrary range of items in a large collection, enumeration of part
            of the list (not just the entire list), and reverse enumeration, and a 
            few compound operations.
            <para/>
            Duplicate keys are not allowed in a BDictionary. If you would like to be
            able to associate multiple values with a single key, use 
            <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.BMultiMap`2"/> instead. 
            <para/>
            If you need to store only keys, not values, use <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.BList`1"/> 
            instead (but note that BList does allow duplicate keys).

            You should not notice any difference between the two, but the stupid 
            .NET type system  insists that the two types are not compatible. So, if 
            (for some reason) you already happen to have a <see cref="T:System.Comparison`1"/> 
            delegate, you must explicitly convert it to a Func delegate with code 
            such as "new Func&lt;K,K,int&gt;(comparisonDelegate)".

            If you leave out the compareKeys parameter, <see cref="P:System.Collections.Generic.Comparer`1.Default"/>.Compare

            <para/>
            An empty BDictionary is created with no root node, so it consumes much less 
            memory than a BDictionary with a single element.
