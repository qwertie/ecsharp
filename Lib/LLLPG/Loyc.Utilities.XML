            This method does not do a bounding-box check. If you are doing 
            calculations with line segments and you expect the majority of your
            intersection calculations to return false, you may save time by 
            testing whether the bounding boxes of the lines overlap before calling 
            this method.
            <para/>
            If the input segments contain NaNs, the result is false and pFrac/qFrac
            will be NaN.
            <para/>
            If the either of the line segments are degenerate (single points), 
            overlap can still be detected and the LineType of the degenerate line
            has no effect; the degenerate line is always treated as a point.
            If both lines are points, the method will return true iff they are the
            same point, and if true is returned, pFrac will be 0.5f
            <para/>
            The output fractions pFrac and qFrac will be infinite if the magnitude 
            of the result overflows.
            <para/>
            If the two line segments are parallel but do not overlap, this method
            returns false; pFrac and qFrac are both set to NaN. If the two lines 
            are parallel and overlap, a region of overlap is detected and pFrac
            and qFrac refer to the center of this region of overlap. If, in this
            case, P and/or Q are rays or infinite lines, this method behaves as
            though P and/or Q are extended to cover each other. For instance, 
            suppose that P and Q are lines on the X axis, P.A.X=0, P.B.X=6, 
            Q.A.X=10, Q.B.X=16:
            <pre>
                   P.A---------------P.B         Q.B---------------------Q.A

            </pre>
            If P and Q are both line segments, there is no overlap and this method 
            will return false. However, if Q is a Ray or an infinite line, it 
            extends toward negative infinity and the minimum overlap between the 
            lines is 0..6. In this case, the region of overlap is considered to be 
            0..6 if P is a line segment, and 0..16 if P is a ray or an infinite 
            line. If P is a line segment, the midpoint is 3, and pFrac will be set
            to 0.5, halfway along the line, while qFrac will be 2.333. If P is a 
            ray or an infinite line, the midpoint is 8, pFrac will be 1.333, and
            qFrac will be 1.333.

            This is not a general cross product, as cross product is only a 3D concept,

            This value is zero if the vectors are parallel; it is a.Length * b.Length

             in the Go programming language.</summary>
             <remarks>
             In the Go programming language, you do not say explicitly that your type 
             implements a given interface. Instead, a type is convertable to <i>any</i>
             interface, just so long as it implements all the methods in the interface.
             This often reminds people of "duck typing" in dynamic languages such as 
             Python or Ruby, but it is faster; in fact, Go interface calls are the same 
             speed as virtual method calls in C++ and C#!
             <para/>
             To put it in C# terms, if you have a class T...
             <pre>public class T {
                 public void Foo(int x);
             }</pre>
             
             ...and an interface called "Interface"...
             
             <pre>public interface Interface {
                 void Foo(int x);
             }</pre>
            
             ...then you can cast T to Interface even though T does not explicitly implement it.
            
             <pre>Interface t = new T();</pre>
             
             This cast can be implicit since the compiler can tell at compile time that
             T implements the Interface. However, you can cast any object to Interface 
             and, at run-time, Go will determine whether it implements the Interface.
             <para/>
             I asked how Go dispatch works on the "Go Nuts" google group and was pointed 
             to two articles:
             <para/>
             http://research.swtch.com/2009/12/go-data-structures-interfaces.html
             http://www.airs.com/blog/archives/281
             <para/>
             To summarize those, the first time you convert a type "T" to an interface 
             "Interface", a vtable (virtual function table) is generated just like the 
             kind used for virtual calls in .NET and C++. However, instead of storing 
             the vtable in the object itself like C++ and .NET do, Go stores the vtable 
             pointer alongside the interface pointer (i.e. an interface pointer is 
             really two pointers). This simple but unique design allows a single object
             to implement an unlimited number of interfaces with overall performance 
             that is competitive with C# and Java.
             <para/>
             Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, there is no way to efficiently
             implement this same technique in .NET without changing the CLR itself. A
             virtual method table is just a list of pointers to functions; importantly,
             function pointers in a virtual method table are not associated with a
             specific object, which makes them different from .NET delegates. By not
             associating the vtable with a specific object, it is possible to re-use the
             same vtable with any number of objects (as long as they are of the same
             class). However, .NET delegates are associated with specific objects, so we
             can't use them to form a reusable vtable.
             <para/>
             Even if .NET allowed delegates that are not associated with a specific
             object, delegate invocation on .NET is slower than virtual method
             invocation; why this is so is not entirely clear to me, but part of the
             reason may be that Microsoft decided to make delegates reference types when
             they should have been a simpler 8-byte value type (just bundling a function
             pointer with a 'this' pointer).
             <para/>
             However, just a few days ago I learned that Visual Basic 9 has a very
             similar feature to Go called "dynamic interfaces", which pretty much lets
             you do as described above (albeit only in Visual Basic). So far I've heard
             nothing about how VB's dynamic interfaces work, but I got to thinking: how
             hard would it be to bring go-style interfaces to all .NET languages, and
             would it be possible to get good performance?
             <para/>
             The technique I chose doesn't have performance as good as you would get from
             Go, but in exchange for a small performance hit (which I believe to be
             unavoidable anyway), the GoInterface classes provide automatic interface
             adaptations that you can't get in Go itself. Specifically, my GoInterface
             classes can automatically do small type conversion tasks like enlarging
             "int" to "long", boxing value types, and allowing return type covariance
             (for instance, if the wrapped method returns a "string", the Interface can
             return an "object".) And since GoInterface returns heap objects that
             actually implement the interface you ask for (rather than, say, an 8-byte
             structure imitating the Go implementation), it's very easy to use.
             <para/>
             The GoInterface classes use .NET Reflection.Emit to generate wrapper classes
             in a "dynamic assembly"--basically a DLL that exists only in memory. Each
             wrapper class implements a single interface of your choosing, and forwards
             calls on that interface to an object of your choosing.
             <para/>
             Given the types from above...
             
             <pre>public class T {
                 public void Foo(int x);
             }
             public interface Interface {
                 void Foo(int x);
             }</pre>
             
             ...you can use GoInterface to cast T to Interface like this:
             
             <pre>Interface t = GoInterface&lt;Interface>.From(new T());</pre>
             
             The first time you cast a T to Interface, GoInterface generates a wrapper 
             class such as the following on-the-fly:
             
             <pre>public class T_46F3E18_46102A0 : Interface
             {
                 T _obj;
                 public T_46F3E18_46102A0(T obj) { _obj = obj; }
                 void Foo(int x) { _obj.Foo(x); }
             }</pre>
             
             The hex numbers in the name of the type are simply handles to interface and 
             type being wrapped, in order to guarantee no name collisions occur when you 
             are wrapping a lot of different classes with GoInterface.
             <para/>
             After the first cast, all future casts are fairly fast, especially if you
             call GoInterface&lt;Interface,T>.From() instead of just
             GoInterface&lt;Interface>.From(). That's because after
             GoInterface&lt;Interface,T> is fully initialized, all its From() method does
             is invoke a delegate that contains the following code:
             
             <pre>delegate(T obj) { return new T_46F3E18_46102A0(obj); }</pre>
             
             You can create wrappers with either GoInterface&lt;Interface> or
             GoInterface&lt;Interface, T> (note the extra type argument "T").
             <ul>
             <li>GoInterface&lt;Interface> is intended for creating wrappers when you do
             not know the type of the object at compile time. For example, if you have a
             list of objects of unknown type and you want to cast them to an interface,
             use this one.</li>
             <li>GoInterface&lt;Interface, T> creates wrappers when you already know the
             type of the object at compile time. This version assumes that T itself (and
             not some derived class!) contains the methods you want to call.
             GoInterface&lt;Interface, T> has the disadvantage that it is unable to call
             methods in a derived class of T. For example, you should not use
             GoInterface&lt;Interface, object> because the object class does not contain
             a Foo method.</li>
             </ul>
             If you're not sure which one to use, use GoInterface&lt;Interface>. If you
             need to adapt a large number of objects to a single interface, you should
             use GoInterface&lt;Interface, T> where possible, because it is slightly
             faster. GoInterface&lt;Interface>, in contrast, has to examine each object
             it is given to find out its most derived type. However, this process is
             optimized so that an expensive analysis is only done once per derived type,
             after which only a hashtable lookup is required.
             <para/>
             Compared to interfaces in the Go programming language, which have a 1-word
             overhead for every interface pointer (the vtable pointer, which is 4 bytes
             in 32-bit code), GoInterface wrappers normally have 3 words of overhead (2
             words for the wrapper's object header and 1 word for a reference to the
             wrapped object). Also, GoInterface wrapper classes are no doubt much more
             costly to produce (since they involve run-time code generation), which will
             increase your program's startup time and have a fixed memory overhead that
             dwarfs Go's implementation. However, once you are up-and-running with
             GoInterface wrappers, their performance should be pretty good. TODO:
             benchmarks
             <para/>
             Note: GoInterface can create wrappers for value types (structures), not just
             classes. Such wrappers have the same memory overhead as boxed structures,
             which is one word less than wrappers for reference types.
             <para/>
             GoInterface wrappers automatically forward calls to object.ToString(),
             object.GetHashCode() and object.Equals(), even though these methods are 
             not technically part of the interface being wrapped.
             <para/>
             GoInterface cannot wrap explicit interface implementations in the target
             class. For instance, if the target class implements IEnumerable(of T), that
             interface has two versions of the GetEnumerator function that differ only by
             return type (one returns IEnumerator and the other returns IEnumerator(of
             T)), so one of them must be implemented "explicitly". GoInterface will
             typically only see the version that returns IEnumerator(of T), but this is
             not a problem since IEnumerator(of T) is implicitly convertable to
             IEnumerator, so GoInterface can use that one method to represent either of 
             them. In Visual Basic there is a caveat, since an explicit interface
             implementation is allowed to be public. In that case, GoInterface will only 
             see the method's public name (not the name used in the interface).

            <remarks>
            Before generating code for the method, we must find a matching 
            method of T. Note that we want to support various kinds of
            "variance", including boxing if necessary:
            <para/>
            - Return type covariance. If T's method returns a derived class,
              Interface's method can return a base class or interface. Also, 
              allow any return type if baseMethod returns void.
            - "out" parameter covariance.
            - T's "out" argument(s) can be absent from Interface, as long as
              they are at the end of the argument list.
            - Interface's input arguments can be absent from T, as long as the
              missing parameters come at the end of the argument list.
            - Input parameter contravariance. If T's method accepts a base class
              (or interface) such as "object", Interface's method can accept a 
              derived class (or a class that implements said interface).
            - If T takes a "ref" argument, allow the method in Interface not to
              be "ref" and vice versa.
            - T's method can be static
            <para/>
            Implicit conversion operators are not currently detected, except 
            primitive type conversions like Int16 to Float that C# allows you 
            to do implicitly. Information-losing conversions like Int64 to 
            Int32 are not supported.
            <para/>
            Variable argument lists are not supported specifically (they are 
            treated as arrays).
            <para/>
            Generic methods in T and Interface are not supported.
            <para/>
            Default (optional) arguments are generally supported.
            <para/>
            Argument names are ignored and need not match.
            <para/>
            Methods that differ only in case are not considered, but Aliases 
            specified with GoAliasAttribute are considered if a matching method 
            with the original name could not be found. All matching aliases are 
            considered together, as if they were overloads of each other.
            <para/>
            We scan all methods of "T" with a matching name and find the best
            match, since there may be multiple methods matching these
            requirements. For the most part I try to follow the rules of 
            the C# standard (ECMA-334 §14.4.2.1 and §14.4.2.2), but be a little 
            more liberal. The way I figure it, "void" should be treated like a
            base class of "object". Note that this matching algorithm may reject
            all overloads due to "ambiguity", in case one overload is not better
            than all others.

            <summary>
            This attribute marks a field in an abstract class as pointing to a wrapped
            object to which GoInterface should forward calls. It is used when you want
            GoInterface to "complete" a decorator pattern for you.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            After writing the basic functionality of GoInterface, I realized it could
            also serve as a handy way to implement the Decorator pattern. A decorator
            is a class that wraps around some target class (usually sharing the same
            interface or base class), while modifying the functionality of the target.
            For instance, you could write a decorator for TextWriter that filters out 
            curse words, replacing them with asterisks.
            <para/>
            Writing decorators is sometimes inconvenient because you only want to 
            modify the behavior of some functions while leaving others alone. 
            Without GoInterface, you must write a wrapper for every method, manually 
            forwarding calls from the decorator to the target.
            <para/>
            GoInterface can help by generating forwarding functions automatically.
            <para/>
            The example shows how to use GoInterface to help you make a decorator.

            With SimpleTimer, the timer starts when you construct the object and

            you have to call ElapsedMilliseconds, then Reset(), then Start().

            SimpleTimer cannot be used to measure time periods longer than 24.8 
            days. The 32-bit millisecond counter will overflow and Millisec will

            treated as an argument to -a. Now, if '1' is a registered short option

            "--out foo.txt" and you want to recognize "foo.txt" as the argument to
            "--out", add the string "out" to this set. If you want to treat <i>all</i>
            options this way, use <c>InvertibleSet{string}.All</c>. Note: 
            If the input is "--out:foo bar", "foo" is recognized as the argument to
            "--out" and "bar" is left alone, i.e. it is treated as unrelated.
              Short options participate automatically. For example if "-f" means 
            "--foo", and twoArgOptions contains "foo", then "-f arg" is interpreted 
            like "--foo=arg".
            <para/>
            The argument will not be treated as an argument if it starts with a 
            dash, e.g. in <c>--foo -*</c>, <c>-*</c> will not be treated as an 
            argument to <c>--foo</c>, even if <c>-*</c> is not a registered option.
            </param>
            <param name="argLimit">A limit placed on the number of arguments when
            expanding @files. Such a file may refer to itself, and this is the only
            protection provided against infinite recursive expansion.</param>
            <param name="expandEnvVars">If true, environment variable references
            such as <c>%TEMP%</c> are expanded by calling the standard method
            <see cref="M:System.Environment.ExpandEnvironmentVariables(System.String)"/>.</param>
            <param name="caseSensitiveLongOpts">If true, long options are case-
            sensitive. By default, long options are not case sensitive.</param>
            <remarks>
            Two types of options are recognized, short (-s) and long (--long), and
            only one argument is supported per option. The documentation is above.
            <para/>
            You can choose whether to permit duplicate options or not. If you use
            a standard <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2"/> to hold the options, an 
            exception will occur when this method calls Add() to add the duplicate. 
            The exception is caught, the first ocurrance is kept, and a warning 
            message is printed to <see cref="P:Loyc.MessageSink.Current"/>.
            <para/>
            To allow duplicates, store options in a different data structure such as 
            <c>List(KeyValuePair(string, string))</c> or <c>BMultiMap(string,string)</c>.
            <para/>
            DOS-style slash-options like /foo are not supported. Since Windows
            recognizes the forward slash as a path separator, forward-slash options
            can be recognized as paths. If you want to recognize them as options 
            instead, you can preprocess the argument list, replacing every command 
            that starts with "/" with a "--" command:
            <code>
              for (int i = 0; args.Count &gt; i; i++)
                if (args[i].StartsWith("/")) 
                  args[i] = "--" + args[i].Substring(1);
            </code>
            <para/>
            Globs (e.g. *.txt) are not recognized or expanded, but environment 
            variables are expanded when <c>expandEnvVars</c> is true.
            <para/>
            Quote marks are not processed. An argument of <c>"--a"</c>, with quote 
            marks, is not recognized as an option (these quote marks should be 
            removed before calling this method, e.g. 
            <see cref="M:Loyc.G.SplitCommandLineArguments(System.String)"/> handles this.)
