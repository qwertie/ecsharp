            <summary>Trivia injector customized for Enhanced C#.</summary>
            <remarks>
            How newline trivia works in EC# (mostly this is the same as 
            <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.StandardTriviaInjector"/>):
            <ul>
            <li>Implicitly, there is a newline before every node within a braced block,
            and <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.CodeSymbols.TriviaAppendStatement"/> is required to suppress 
            it. The Loyc tree does not specify whether or not there is a newline before
            the closing brace; it is assumed that there should be a newline unless ALL
            children of the braced block use #trivia_appendStatement.</li>
            <li>Implicitly, there is a newline before every top-level statement except 
            the first, and #trivia_appendStatement can be used to suppress it.</li>
            <li>By default, the printer doesn't print a newline before an opening brace.
            #trivia_newline can be added to the braced block node to represent one.</li>
            <li>This injector explicitly encodes newlines in all other locations. 
            However, the EC# printer is designed to print all syntax trees reasonably 
            whether they have passed through the trivia injector or not. Therefore, on
            non-braced-block child statements of certain nodes (if statements, while
            loops, for loops, and other statements used without braces), the printer
            will print a newline before a child statement if it (1) does not have 
            #trivia_newline or #trivia_appendStatement attributes and (2) does not have 
            an ancestor with the <see cref="F:Loyc.Syntax.NodeStyle.OneLiner"/> style.</li>
            <li>In an if-else statement, `else` has no representation in the syntax 
            tree and may appear to the injector the same as a blank line. In this 
            situation the first newline is attached to the child of #if at index 1,
            and is deleted so that there is only one newline before the second child.</li>
            <li>Constructors that call another constructor (`: base(...)`) get a 
            newline before the colon by default, which can be suppressed with 
            #trivia_appendStatement. Note: These constructors have an unusual syntax 
            tree which the standard trivia injector can't handle properly; see comment 
            in DoneAttaching() for details.</li>

            <summary>Handles EC# processor directives.</summary>
            <remarks>This class not only preprocesses C# source code, it saves 
            preprocessor directives and comments so that any code excluded by the 
            preprocessor can be added back in later, if and when the parsed code is 
            printed out. For example, given input like this:
            <code>
               void foo // see below
               #if false
               invalid code!
               #endif
               () { Console.WriteLine("foo()!"); }
            </code>
            EcsPreprocessor removes the #if...#endif region of tokens, creates a 
            single Token of type TokenType.PPFalseBlock to represent that region, and
            saves it, after the "see below" comment token, in a list.
            <para/>
            C# has the following preprocessor directives:
            <code>
            #define Id
            #undef Id
            #if expr
            #elif expr
            #else
            #endif
            #warning {arbitrary text}
            #error {arbitrary text}
            #region {arbitrary text}
            #endregion

            <summary>Tests handling of the constructor ambiguity</summary>
            <remarks>
            Constructors look like ordinary method calls. In fact, EC# parsing
            rules do not allow the parser to look at the argument list to 
            determine whether a method is a constructor, and method bodies are
            not required on methods. Furthermore, the parser does not 
            distinguish between executable and non-executable contexts. So
            it's impossible to tell whether
            <code>
            Foo(x);
            Foo(x, y) { }
            </code>
            is a pair of constructors, or a method call plus a macro call. To 
            resolve this conundrum, the parser keeps track of the name of the 
            current class, for the sole purpose of detecting the constructor. 
            The printer, meanwhile, must detect a method call that may be 
            mistaken for a constructor and reformat it as <c>(Foo(x))</c>. Also, 
            when a constructor definition is printed, it must use prefix 
            notation if the name does not match the enclosing class:
            <code>
            #cons(@``, Foo, #(int x), { ... });
            </code>
            When the constructor is called 'this', this(x) is assumed to be a 
            constructor, but that creates a new problem in EC# because you will 
            be allowed to call a constructor inside a constructor body:
            <code>
            this(int x) { this(x, x); }
            </code>
            This parses successfully because the parser will not allow 
            constructor definitions inside methods. The printer, in turn, will
            track whether it is in a space definition or not. It can print a
            constructor that is directly within a space definition, but in other
            contexts will use prefix notation to ensure that round-tripping 
            succeeds. When the syntax tree contains a method call to 'this' 
            (which is stored as #this internally), it may have to be enclosed 
            in parens or shown as `#this` to avoid ambiguity.
            <para/>
            Finally, a constructor with the wrong name can still be parsed if
            it calls some other constructor with a colon:
            <code>
            class Foo { Fub() : base() { } }
            </code>

            methods like <see cref="M:Loyc.Ecs.EcsNodePrinter.PrintLiteral(System.Object,Loyc.Syntax.NodeStyle)"/> and <see cref="M:Loyc.Ecs.EcsNodePrinter.PrintId(Loyc.Symbol,System.Boolean)"/> that
            are useful for printing tokens efficiently.
            <para/>
            This class is designed to faithfully preserve most Loyc trees; almost any 
            Loyc tree that can be represented as EC# source code will be represented 
            properly by this class, so that it is possible to parse the output text 
            back into a Loyc tree equivalent to the one that was printed. Originally 
            this class was meant to provide round-tripping from Loyc trees to text and 
            back, but Enhanced C# is syntactically very complicated and as a result 
            this printer may contain bugs or (for the sake of practicality) minor 
            intentional limitations that cause round-tripping not to work in rare 
            cases. If you need perfect round-tripping, use LES instead 
            (<see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.Les.LesLanguageService"/>).
            <para/>
            Only the attributes, head (<see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LiteralNode.Value"/>, 
            <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.IdNode.Name"/> or <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.CallNode.Target"/>), and arguments 
            of nodes are round-trippable. Superficial properties such as original 
            source code locations and the <see cref="P:Loyc.Syntax.LNode.Style"/> are, in 
            general, lost, although the printer can faithfully reproduce some (not 
            all) <see cref="T:Loyc.Syntax.NodeStyle"/>s (this caveat applies equally to LES). Also, 
            any attribute whose Name starts with "#trivia_" may be dropped, because 
            these attributes are considered extensions of the NodeStyle. However, the 
            style indicated by the #trivia_* attribute will be used if the printer 
            recognizes it.
            <para/>
            For round-tripping to work, there are a couple of restrictions on the 
            input tree:
            <ol>
            <li>Only literals that can exist in C# source code are allowed. For 
                example, Values of type int, string, and double are acceptable, but
                Values of type Regex or int[] are not, because single tokens cannot
                represent these types in C# source code. The printer ignores Values of 
                non-literal nodes, and non-representable literals are printed out
                using ToString().</li>
            <li>Names must come from the global symbol pool (<see cref="F:Loyc.GSymbol.Pool"/>).
                The printer will happily print Symbols from other pools, but there is
                no way to indicate the pool in source code, so the parser always 
                recreates symbols in the global pool. Non-global symbols are used
                after semantic analysis, so there is no way to faithfully represent
                the results of semantic analysis.</li>
            </ol>
