            WARNING: When casting a point (or vector) structure to this interface, 
            it is boxed, making a copy. Changes made through a reference to IPoint3 do 
            not affect the original point!
            <para/>
            The coordinates of an IPoint3 are separated into a base interface, 
            <see cref="T:Loyc.Geometry.IPoint3Base`1"/>, for the same reason that <see cref="T:Loyc.Geometry.IPoint`1"/>'s
            coordinates are separated into <see cref="T:Loyc.Geometry.IPointBase`1"/>, as explained in

            This is not a general cross product, as cross product is only a 3D concept,
            but this operator acts as though the two points were in the Z=0 plane and
            returns the Z coordinate of the cross product: b.X * a.Y - b.Y * a.X.
            This value is zero if the vectors are parallel; it is a.Length * b.Length 
            or -a.Length * b.Length if the vectors are perpendicular. One use of 
            cross product is to determine whether the angle between two lines is greater

            <remarks>
            The .NET collection classes have a very simple and coarse interface.
            <para/>
            Member list:
            <code>
            public T this[int index] { get; }
            public T TryGet(int index, ref bool fail);
            public Iterator&lt;T&gt; GetIterator();
            public int Count { get; }
            public IEnumerator&lt;T&gt; GetEnumerator();
            System.Collections.IEnumerator System.Collections.IEnumerable.GetEnumerator();
            </code>
            The term "source" means a read-only collection, as opposed to a "sink" which
            is a write-only collection. The purpose of IListSource is to make it easier
            to implement a read-only list, by lifting IList's requirement to write 
            implementations for Add(), Remove(), etc. A secondary purpose is, of course,
            to guarantee users don't mistakenly call those methods on a read-only
            collection.
            <para/>
            I have often wanted to access the "next" or "previous" item in a list, e.g.
            during parsing, but it inconvenient if you have to worry about whether the 
            the current item is the first or last. In that case you must check whether
            the array index is valid, which is both inconvenient and wasteful, because
            the list class will check the array index again, and then the .NET runtime
            will check the index a third time when reading the internal array. To make
            this more efficient, IListSource has a TryGet() method that does not throw
            on failure, but returns default(T).
            <para/>
            As IListSource is supposed to be a simpler alternative to IList, I didn't
            want to require implementers to implement more than two indexers. There are
            two additional TryGet extension methods, though:
            <code>
                bool TryGet(int index, ref T value);
                T TryGet(int, T defaultValue);
            </code>
            If T is defined as "out" (covariant) in C# 4, these methods are not allowed 
            in IListSource anyway and MUST be extension methods.
            <para/>
            Note that "value" is a "ref" rather than an "out" parameter, unlike
            Microsoft's own TryGetValue() implementations. Using ref parameter allows
            the caller to choose his own default value in case TryGet() returns false.
            <para/>
            Using <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.ListSourceBase`1"/> as your base class can help you
            implement this interface faster.

            <summary>
            This class contains extension methods that are provided as part of various 
            Loyc.Collections interfaces. For example, it provides methods such as IndexOf(),
            Contains() and CopyTo(), that the traditional <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.ICollection`1"/> 
            and <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IList`1"/> interfaces require the author to write himself.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            For covariant collections such as <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IReadOnlyCollection`1"/> and <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IListSource`1"/>, the CLR actually prohibits methods such as 
            Contains(T) and IndexOf(T), because T is not allowed in "input" positions. 
            Therefore, these extension methods must be used to fill the gap. Even
            methods such as <i>bool TryGet(int, out T)</i> are prohibited, so TryGet()
            has the signature <i>T TryGet(ref bool failed)</i> instead, and extension
            methods provide the original version of the method in addition.

            <remarks>
            Ranges are a concept I first saw formalized in the D programming language.
            They are generally more useful than .NET enumerators because there are 
            more kinds of them:
            <ul>
            <li>A forward range (<see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IFRange`1"/>) is a sequence of values 
            accessed starting with the first, like <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator`1"/>. A 
            forward range is like IEnumerator, except that it can be cloned, so you 
            can restart from the same place later. This is more powerful than 
            <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1"/>, which can only restart from the beginning.</li>
            <li>A bidirectional range inherits from the forward range, and provides
            access to the back of the sequence as well as the front. A bidirectional
            iterators may, for example, represent a linked list, or a UTF-8 string 
            that provides access to the first and last 32-bit code point (note that
            random access by character index is not really possible in UTF-8 data,
            since the size of N characters is unknown).</li>
            <li>A random-access range is a sequence that provides array-like access
            to a section of a list. A section of a list is called a "slice".</li>
            </ul>
            A range is read-only by default, but has a writable variant marked
            with the letter M, meaning "Mutable": <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IMFRange`1"/>, 
            <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IMBRange`1"/>, <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IMRange`1"/>.
            <para/>
            It is fair to ask why IFRange exists--since it behaves like an enumerator,
            why not simply use IEnumerator directly? Well, this interface serves as 
            the base interface for the other ranges, so its interface needs to make
            sense in that context. IEnumerator has "Current" and "MoveNext" methods,
            but in a bidirectional or random-access range, there is no single 
            "Current" or "Next" item.
            <para/>
            Also, when used through an interface, IFRange is potentially more 
            efficient than IEnumerator: you only need to call a single method, 
            PopFirst(), to get the next item, unlike IEnumerator which requires two 
            interface calls per iteration. That can improve performance, since 
            interface calls cannot be inlined. It is a bit inconvenient to use
            <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.IFRange`1.PopFront(System.Boolean@)"/> because of its "out" argument, and 
            more convenient extension methods would have been provided if C# 
            supported "ref Type this", which would be needed since ranges are
            often value types.
            <para/>
            Ranges are useful for implementing algorithms; they are comparable to
            the concept of "iterators" in C++, except that a range represents a 
            pair of iterators instead of a single iterator. And like C++ iterators,
            they are a useful starting point for writing generic algorithms.
            <para/>
            When using a range that is not typed <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IFRange`1"/>, you need to
            be careful how you use it because the range could be a struct type. Much 
            like an enumerator, a range is often a small wrapper around a larger data
            structure; therefore, it often makes sense to implement a range as a 
            struct. When a range is a struct, normally you are making a copy of it 
            whenever you assign it to a different variable, or pass it to another 
            method:
            <code>
                Range b = a;
                a.PopFirst(); // may not affect b if Range is a struct
            </code>
            In fact, a range should not be copied this way because assignment may or
            may not create a copy. You should avoid simple assignment, and use 
            Clone() to copy a range instead:
            <code>
                Range b = a.Clone();
                a.PopFirst(); // will not affect b, and you can be sure of it
            </code>
            However, if a range is a reference type or a reference to IFRange, you 
            are not making a copy of it when you assign it or pass it to another 
            method:
            <code>
                IFRange&lt;T&gt; a = ...;
                IFRange&lt;T&gt; b = a;
                a.PopFirst(); // The item was popped from b also
            </code>
            When writing generic code, you may want to use range types directly, as in:
            <code>
                void DoSomethingWithRange&lt;R,T&gt;(R range) where R : IRange&lt;T&gt; {...}
            </code>
            Using a range type directly can improve performance if R happens to be 
            a struct type, since there is no need to box the range when passing it 
            to this method. However, it is very important to keep in mind that "R" 
            may be a struct or a class. If this method is not intended to modify the 
            range from the perspective of the caller, the method must start by cloning 
            the range, in case R is a class or interface type:
            <code>
                void DoSomethingWithRange&lt;R,T&gt;(R range) where R : IBRange&lt;T&gt; {
                    range = range.Clone();
                    ...
                }
            </code>
            On the other hand, if this method <i>wants</i> the caller to see the 
            changes to the range, R must be passed by reference, in case it is a
            struct type:
            <code>
                void DoSomethingWithRange&lt;R,T&gt;(ref R range) where R : IBRange&lt;T&gt; {
                    ...
                }
            </code>
            To avoid these subtle difficulties, you can access the range through
            the <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IFRange`1"/> interface; just remember to Clone() the 
            range when necessary.
            <para/>
            Remember that a range is an alias for some underlying data structure.
            If the original data structure is modified, a range will "see" those
            changes. For instance, suppose that a range provides a slice from 
            indexes 5 to 12 inclusive within an <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IList`1"/> object 
            that contains 15 items:
            <pre>
                IList  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 
                       a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o 
                IRange                0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
            </pre>
            Thus, [0] in the range corresponds to item [5] in the list, "f". Now, 
            if the first three items in the list are removed, then [0] in the range 
            will still correspond to item [5] in the list, but the item at this 
            location, marked "i", used to be at index [8]:
            <pre>
                IList  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
                       d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m  n  o
                IRange                0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
            </pre>
            The exact behavior of the range at this point is implementation-dependent.
            The <c>Count</c> property may remain at 8, or it may drop to 7; perhaps the
            range will return default(T) when you read index [7], or perhaps it will
            throw <see cref="T:System.IndexOutOfRangeException"/>.

            Since .NET does not allow static members in an interface, the static
            members can be found in <see cref="T:Loyc.Utilities.MessageSink"/>.
            <para/>
            Each message has a "type" <see cref="T:Loyc.Symbol"/> which indicates the 
            type of message being printed. For message sinks that are used as 
            loggers, this should be one of the following logging levels, listed
            in order of importance: Fatal, Error, Warning, Note, Debug, Verbose.
            For message sinks that are used for compiler messages, the standard
            levels are: Fatal, Error, SoftError, Warning, Note, Detail. "SoftError"
            is intended to describe code that is technically illegal, but which
            does not impede code generation. "Detail" provides more information 
            about a previously-printed message, while "Note" is intended for
            independent messages that are less severe than warnings.
            <para/>
            The message sink itself should perform localization, which can be done
            with <see cref="M:Loyc.Localize.From(Loyc.Symbol,System.String,System.Object[])"/>.
            <para/>
            Only a single Write() method is truly needed (<see cref="M:Loyc.Utilities.IMessageSink.Write(Loyc.Symbol,System.Object,System.String,System.Object[])"/>),
            but efficiency reasons the interface contains two other writers. It 
            is expected to be fairly common that a message sink will drop some or
            all messages without printing them, e.g. if a message sink is used for 
            logging, verbose messages might be "off" by default. It would be 
            wasteful to actually localize and format a message if the message will
            not actually be printed, and it would also be wasteful to create an array 
            of objects to hold the arguments if they are just going to be discarded.
            With that in mind, since most formatting requests only need a couple of 
            arguments, there is an overload of Write() that accepts up to two
            arguments without the need to package them into an array, and there is
            an overload that takes no formatting arguments (this indicates that 
            parameter substitution is not required and should not be attempted.)

            <remarks>
            The relationship between X1, X2 and Width, and the relationship between 
            Y1, Y2 and Height, depends on whether the object represents a normal 
            (traditional Windows) rectangle, a bounding rectangle, or a pair of 
            points. A traditional rectangle defines its Height as Y2 - Y1, and its
            Width as X2 - X1. A bounding rectangle is defined slightly differently:
            the Width is X2 - X1 + e, and the Height is Y2 - Y1 + e, where e is an
            infitessimal value of type T (e=1 if T is an integer type).
            <para/>
            Also, a traditional rectangle is stored as a starting point (X1, Y1)
            and a size (Width, Height), while a bounding rectangle stores X2 and Y2 
            instead, not the Width and Height.
            <para/>
            Finally, this interface could simply represent a pair of points. In 
            that case, Width and Height return the absolute value of X2-X1 and 
            Y2-Y1 respectively.
            <para/>
            A rectangle may or may not require X2 &gt;= X1 and Y2 &gt;= Y1. If X1&gt;X2 or
            Y1&gt;Y2, the rectangle is said to be "not normalized" and the 
            <see cref="M:Loyc.Geometry.RectangleExt.IsNormal``2(``0)"/> extension method returns false.

            <typeparam name="T">Type of each coordinate.</typeparam>
            <remarks>
            This interface can represent one of three types of rectangles: either 
            "normal" rectangles with fundamental variables X, Y, Width, Height, 
            bounding rectangles with two coordinate ranges (X1-X2) and (Y1-Y2), or
            or pairs of points (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2).
            <para/>
            Because of this fact, it is not clear when you modify X1 whether this
            should affect X2 or Width. Similarly, when you modify X2, Y1 or Y2, it
            is not clear whether the size property or the opposite boundary should 
            change. To resolve this question, this interface does not allow you to
            modify the coordinates individually; instead you must change them in 
            pairs: you either set X and Width together, or X1 and X2 together; and
            similarly Y and Height together, or Y1 and Y2 together.
            <para/>
            You can also call the extension methods SetRect() or SetRange() to set
            all four coordinates at once.

            </code>
            where Digits refers to one digits in the requested base, possibly 
            including underscores or spaces if the flags allow it; similarly, 
            DecimalDigits refers to base-10 digits and is also affected by the
            flags.
            <para/>
            Returns false if there was an error interpreting the input.
            <para/>
            To keep the parser relatively simple, it does not roll back in case of 
            error the way the int parser does. For example, given the input "23p", 
            the 'p' is consumed and causes the method to return false, even though
            the parse could have been successful if it had ignored the 'p'.

            Encapsulates the <see cref="E:Loyc.Collections.INotifyListChanging`1.ListChanging"/> event that notifies listeners 
            of dynamic changes to an indexed list, such as when items get added and

            <typeparam name="T">Type of items in the list</typeparam>
            <remarks>
            This approach to change notification is more lightweight than the standard
            <see cref="T:System.Collections.Specialized.INotifyCollectionChanged"/> interface because that interface
            sends both a list of new items and a list of old items, so many changes
            require a pair of temporary objects to be created that hold the two lists
            of items.
            <para/>
            In contrast, the <see cref="E:Loyc.Collections.INotifyListChanging`1.ListChanging"/> event includes only one list 
            that specifies the set of new items. In the case of Remove events, no change
            list is included. Since the collection has not been modified yet, the user
            handling the event can examine the list to learn which item(s) are being
            removed; if the list is being changed, it can similarly examine the list
            to see the old set of items.
            <para/>
            An optimization is available when only a single item is being added or
            changed. In that case, the collection class should create a lightweight 
            read-only single-item list by calling <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Range.Single``1(``0)"/>.
            Such a list has less overhead than <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.List`1"/> and the same
            overhead as an array of one item.

            The event handler is not allowed to modify the list that is changing

            IMPORTANT: if the event handler throws an exception, the change does 
            not actually happen. Collections that support this event must ensure

            </summary>
            <remarks>Although there is a ICloneable{R} constraint on R, it is currently
            worthless due to a limitation of C#. Since <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IFRange`1"/> already
            includes <c>ICloneable(IFRange(T))</c>, this structure cannot simply
            invoke Clone() directly because the compiler complains that Clone() is 
            ambiguous. Consequently it is necessary to cast the range to <see cref="T:Loyc.ICloneable`1"/> just to clone it; if R is a value type then it is
            boxed, which defeats the entire performance advantage of calling 
            <c>ICloneable{R}.Clone()</c> instead of <c>ICloneable{IFRange{T}}.Clone</c>.
            <para/>
            Nevertheless, I have left the constraint in place, in the hope that EC# can 
            eventually eliminate this limitation thanks to its "using" cast. Once EC#
            compiles directly to CIL, <c>range(using ICloneable&lt;R&gt;).Clone()</c> will 
            not perform boxing.

            to find a Symbol that has already been created.
            <para/>
            Symbols can be used like a global, extensible enumeration. Comparing symbols
            is as fast as comparing two integers; this is because '==' is not
            overloaded--equality is defined as reference equality, as there is only one
            instance of a given Symbol.
            <para/>
            Symbols can also be produced in namespaces called "pools". Two Symbols with
            the same name, but in different pools, are considered to be different
            symbols. Using a derived class D of Symbol and a SymbolPool&lt;D&gt;,
            you can make Symbols that are as type-safe as enums.
            <para/>
            A Symbol's ToString() function formerly returned the symbol name prefixed 
            with a colon (:), following the convention of the Ruby language, from which 
            I got the idea of Symbols in the first place. However, since Symbols are 
            commonly used for extensible enums, I decided it was better that ToString()
            return just the Name alone, which makes Symbol more suitable as a drop-in 
            replacement for enums.

            <remarks>
            There is one global symbol pool (GSymbol.Pool) and you can create an 
            unlimited number of private pools, each with an independent namespace.
            <para/>
            Methods of this class are synchronized, so a SymbolPool can be used from
            multiple threads.
            <para/>
            By default, SymbolPool uses weak references to refer to Symbols, so they 
            can be garbage-collected when no longer in use. When creating a private 
            pool you can tell the SymbolPool constructor to use strong references 
            instead, which ensures that none of the symbols disappear, but risks a 
            memory leak if the pool itself is never garbage-collected. Strong 
            references also require less memory and may be slightly faster.
            <para/>
            By default, all Symbol are given non-negative IDs. GSymbol.Empty (whose 
            Name is "") has an Id of 0, but in a private pool, "" is not treated 
            differently than any other symbol so a new ID will be allocated for it.

            <para/>
            The mutable ranges do not include a clone method due to a limitation of C#.
            C# does not support covariance, which means that every time a derived 
            interface supports cloning, the implementing class is required to write a 
            separate clone method. Read-only ranges already have to implement up to 
            four clone methods: ICloneable{IFRange{T}}, ICloneable{IBRange{T}}, 
            ICloneable{IRange{T}}, and ICloneable{IRangeEx{T}}, and that's in addition 
            to the Clone method for the concrete type! If mutable ranges also supported
            cloning, they would add up to three more clone methods, which is really 
            getting out of hand.
            <para/>
            To limit the maximum number of clone methods to something reasonable, only 
            the immutable ranges have a clone method, but if the original range was 
            mutable then the clone will also be mutable; you just have to cast the 
            result:
            <code>
                var r2 = (IMFRange&lt;T&gt;)r.Clone();

            <remarks>
            The relationship between Z1, Z2 and Depth, as well as between the 
            other coodinates and Width/Height, depends on whether the object represents 
            a starting point plus a size, or a bounding rectangle or a pair of 
            points. Either the object stores a starting point (X1, Y1, Z1) and
            a size (Width, Height, Depth), or it stores a starting point and an
            ending point (X2, Y2, Z2).
            <para/>
            Conventionally, when using the size representation, the Width is 
            defined as X2 - X1, the Height as Y2 - Y1, and the Depth as Z2 - Z1.
            A bounding rectangle is defined slightly differently: the Width is 
            X2 - X1 + e, the Height is Y2 - Y1 + e, and the Depth is Z2 - Z1 + e,
            where e is an infitessimal value of type T (e=1 if T is an integer 
            type).
            <para/>
            Finally, this interface could simply represent a pair of points. In 
            that case, Width and Height return the absolute value of X2-X1 and 
            Y2-Y1 respectively.
            <para/>
            The object may or may not require X2 &gt;= X1 and Y2 &gt;= Y1 and Z2 &gt;= Z1.
            If X1&gt;X2 or Y1&gt;Y2 or Z1&gt;Z2, the rectangle is said to be "not 
            normalized" and the <see cref="M:Loyc.Geometry.Rectangle3Ext.IsNormal``2(``0)"/> extension 
            method returns false.

            <typeparam name="T">Type of each coordinate.</typeparam>
            <remarks>
            This interface can represent one of three types of rectangles: either 
            "normal" rectangles with fundamental variables X, Y, Z, Width, Height, 
            Depth, bounding rectangles with two coordinate ranges (X1-X2), (Y1-Y2),
            and (Z1-Z2), or pairs of points (X1, Y1, Z1) and (X2, Y2, Z2).
            <para/>
            Because of this fact, it is not clear when if modify X1 whether this
            should affect X2 or Width. Similarly for Y1, Z1, X2, Y2 and Z2:
            should the size property or the opposite boundary change?. To resolve 
            this question, this interface does not allow you to modify the 
            coordinates individually; instead you must change them in pairs: you 
            either set X and Width together, or X1 and X2 together; and similarly
            for Y1/Y2/Height and Z1/Z2/Depth.
            <para/>
            You can also call the extension methods SetRect() or SetRange() to set
            all six coordinates at once.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            InternalList is a struct, not a class, in order to save memory; and for 
            maximum performance, it asserts rather than throwing an exception 
            when an incorrect array index is used. Besides that, it has an 
            InternalArray property that provides access to the internal array. 
            For all these reasons one should not expose it in a public API, and 
            it should only be used when performance trumps all other concerns.
            <para/>
            Passing this structure by value is dangerous because changes to a copy 
            of the structure may or may not be reflected in the original list. It's
            best not to pass it around at all, but if you must pass it, pass it by
            reference.
            <para/>
            Also, do not use the default contructor. Always specify an initial 
            capacity or copy InternalList.Empty so that _array gets a value. 
            This is required because methods such as Add(), Insert() and Resize() 
            assume _array is not null.
            <para/>
            InternalList has one nice thing that List(of T) lacks: a <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalList`1.Resize(System.Int32,System.Boolean)"/>
            method and an equivalent Count setter. Which dork at Microsoft decided no 
            one should be allowed to set the list length directly? This type also 
            provides a handy <see cref="P:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalList`1.Last"/> property and a <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalList`1.Pop"/> 
            method to respectively get or remove the last item.
            <para/>
            Finally, alongside InternalList(T), the static class InternalList comes 
            with some static methods (CopyToNewArray, Insert, RemoveAt, Move) to help
            manage raw arrays. You might want to use these in a data structure 
            implementation even if you choose not to use InternalList(T) instances.

            (1.75 to the 1.239th power is about 2.0), but memory utilization is
            increased. With size doubling, the average list uses 2/3 of its 
            entries, but with this resizing pattern, the average list uses 72.72%
            of its entries. The average size of a list is 8.3% lower. Originally
            I used 50% size increases, but they required 71% more allocations,

            <remarks>
            Normally one uses Array.Sort for sorting arrays.
            This method exists because there is no Array.Sort overload that
            accepts both a Comparison and a range (index, count), nor does the
            .NET framework provide access to its internal adapter that converts 
            Comparison to IComparer.
            <para/>
            This quicksort algorithm uses a best-of-three pivot so that it remains
            performant (fast) if the input is already sorted. It is designed to 
            perform reasonably well in case the data contains many duplicates (not
            verified). It is also designed to avoid using excessive stack space if 
            a worst-case input occurs that requires O(N^2) time.

            Some functionality is incomplete at this time, e.g. there are no 
            comparison methods or 128+128 addition/subtraction.
            <para/>
            This class works on raw Int64 values, so a 128-bit number is represented 
            by a pair of Int64s, one with high bits and one with low bits. By 
            convention, the low 64 bits are always unsigned (because they contain no
            sign bit), and the high 64 bits may be signed or unsigned, which 
            represents the sign of the 128-bit number as a whole.
            <para/>
            Many methods pass the low 64 bits by reference and the high 64 bits by 
            value, returning the "new" high 64 bits as the return value. This is done 
            to help implement signed math in terms of unsigned math. If the parameter
            type is "ref ulong", C# does not allow you to pass "ref long", even with
            a cast. Passing the high bits by value is therefore less cumbersome.

            <remarks>
            When dividing a negative number by a positive number, it is 
            conventionally rounded toward zero. Consequently, the remainder is zero 
            or negative to satisfy the standard integer division equation 
            <c>a = b*q + r</c>, where q is the quotient (result) and r is the 
            remainder.
            <para/>
            This is not always what you want. So, if roundDown is true, the result 
            is rounded down instead of toward zero. This ensures that if 'a' is 
            negative and 'b' is positive, the remainder is positive too, a fact 
            which is useful for modulus arithmetic. The table below illustrates

            aH to UInt64. The cast would not be allowed if passing by reference.
            Of course, right shift, on the other hand, requires two separate

            This method does not allow shifting by a negative amount. The reason

            WARNING: When casting a point (or vector) structure to this interface, 
            it is boxed, making a copy. Changes made through a reference to IPoint do 
            not affect the original point!
            <para/>
            It is important to distinguish between generic code that operates on points
            (e.g. Foo&lt;Point,T&gt;(Point x) where Point:IPoint&lt;T&gt;) and code that uses 
            the IPoint interface directly (e.g. Foo(IPoint&lt;int&gt;) or even 
            Foo&lt;T&gt;(IPoint&lt;T&gt; x)). The latter uses slow, late-bound interface 
            calls and the boxing-copy issue mentioned before must be kept in mind.
            Generic code that uses IPoint as a <i>constraint</i>, not as a <i>parameter 
            type,</i> is faster and does not have the same problem because it does not 
            actually box the point, nor does it use late-bound invocation.
            <para/>
            Normally this interface is not used directly, and the only operation
            provided is New(). It is provided in case you want it, but generally
            it's better to use <see cref="T:Loyc.Geometry.Point`1"/>.
            <para/>
            In order for this interface to work more easily in generic code, there is 
            no corresponding IVector type for vectors because generic code must declare 
            every type it needs as a separate type parameter, which makes the code very 
            cumbersome to write already, even without a point/vector distinction.
            <para/>
            The New() method is not normally used in generic code because it returns 
            IPoint&lt;T&gt;, not the original point type. It is provided mainly in case 
            somebody wants to use the raw interface to manipulate points.
            <para/>
            Due to a limitation of C#, the X and Y coordinates are separated into a 
            separate interface (<see cref="T:Loyc.Geometry.IPointBase`1"/>) from the New() method in
            <see cref="T:Loyc.Geometry.INewPoint`2"/>. Without this separation, it's impossible 
            to write fast generic code that can operate on both IPoint itself and on 
            concrete types such as <see cref="T:Loyc.Geometry.Point`1"/>. The reason for this is very 
            subtle. To understand it, consider the following generic method that adds 
            two points together:
            <para/>
            <code>
            public static Point Add&lt;Point,T,M&gt;(this M m, Point a, Point b)
            	where Point : IPoint&lt;T&gt;
            	where M : IAdditionGroup&lt;T&gt;
            {
            	return a.New(m.Add(a.X, b.X), m.Add(a.Y, b.Y));
            }
            </code>
            As written, this code does not compile. The reason is that a.New() does not 
            return a Point; instead, it returns <see cref="T:Loyc.Geometry.IPoint`1"/>, which is a more 
            general (interface) type than Point (which is probably a struct). Therefore, 
            in order for the code above to work, a cast from IPoint to Point would be 
            necessary. However, the boxing performed by new() and the unboxing performed 
            by the cast will slow down the method. My goal, however, is to allow generic
            code to run fast; otherwise it's hard to justify the extra effort required 
            to make the code generic. After all, the code to add non-generic points is
            trivial in comparison:
            <code>
            public static PointD Add(PointD a, PointD b) { return a + b; }
            </code>
            You might think to yourself, "okay, why don't we just add a new() 
            constraint on Point?" In that case the Add() method can be written as 
            follows:
            <code>
            public static Point Add&lt;Point,T,M&gt;(this M m, Point a, Point b)
            	where Point : IPoint&lt;T&gt;, new()
            	where M : IAdditionGroup&lt;T&gt;
            {
            	Point p = new Point();
            	p.X = m.Add(a.X, b.X);
            	p.Y = m.Add(a.Y, b.Y);
            	return p;
            }
            </code>
            This works if the input is a concrete point type, but this version of the 
            method cannot be used if Point happens to be <see cref="T:Loyc.Geometry.IPoint`1"/> itself;
            you cannot do "new IPoint" because it is an interface. To solve this I 
            considered splitting out New() into a separate interface and using it as a 
            constraint of the generic method:
            <code>
            public static Point Add&lt;Point,T,M&gt;(this M m, Point a, Point b)
            	where Point : IPoint&lt;T&gt;, INewPoint&lt;Point, T&gt;
            	where M : IAdditionGroup&lt;T&gt;
            {
            	return a.New(m.Add(a.X, b.X), m.Add(a.Y, b.Y));
            }
            </code>
            This code compiles under one condition: IPoint must <i>not</i> be derived 
            from INewPoint&lt;IPoint&lt;T&gt;,T&gt;. Because if it is, then the call to New()
            is ambiguous: does a.New() refer to INewPoint&lt;IPoint&lt;T&gt;,T&gt;.New() or 
            to INewPoint&lt;Point,T&gt;.New()? Remember, IPoint is not the same as Point 
            from the compiler's perspective--IPoint is an interface, but Point is 
            typically a struct (it could be the same as IPoint, but in general, it is 
            not). The compiler doesn't know which version of New() to call, so it 
            refuses to compile the code. It will compile if we change the method body 
            to 
            <code>
            	return ((INewPoint&lt;Point,T&gt;)a).New(m.Add(a.X, b.X), m.Add(a.Y, b.Y));
            </code>
            The cast resolves the ambiguity, but as a side-effect, 'a' is boxed and 
            the call to New() becomes a virtual call that cannot be inlined. So the 
            same performance penalty is back!
            <para/>
            But as I was saying, the original code does compile if IPoint is <i>not</i>
            derived from INewPoint. Unfortunately, if IPoint is not derived from 
            INewPoint then it is impossible to pass a reference to IPoint to this 
            method (because it no longer meets the constraints). Remember, that is 
            the limitation I am trying to avoid!
            <para/>
            One more "solution" is not to create any new points:
            <code>
            public static Point Add&lt;Point,T,M&gt;(this M m, Point a, Point b)
            	where Point : IPoint&lt;T&gt;
            	where M : IAdditionGroup&lt;T&gt;
            {
            	a.X = m.Add(a.X, b.X);
            	a.Y = m.Add(a.Y, b.Y);
            	return a;
            }
            </code>
            Alas, this version of the code modifies the point 'a' if Point is IPoint, 
            but it does not modify 'a' if Point is a struct, because structs are passed 
            by value. This inconsistency is not acceptable, and besides, there are
            (of course) situations where creating new points is required.
            <para/>
            The problem is that if there is only one New() method defined (in the 
            point structures such as PointI and PointD) then it's impossible to pass
            references to IPoint to Add(); however, if there are two New() methods (one 
            in the point struct and one in IPoint), it is impossible to tell the C# 
            compiler which method we want to call without slowing down the code as a 
            side-effect. My solution to this very peculiar problem is to split IPoint
            into two independent interfaces, IPointBase and INewPoint. This separation
            allows us to tell the C# compiler that Point implements only one of the 
            New() methods, not both:
            <code>
            public static Point Add&lt;Point,T,M&gt;(this M m, Point a, Point b)
                where Point : IPointBase&lt;T&gt;, INewPoint&lt;Point, T&gt;
                where M : IAdditionGroup&lt;T&gt;
            {
                return a.New(m.Add(a.X, b.X), m.Add(a.Y, b.Y));
            }
            </code>
            IPointBase, unlike IPoint, does not have a New() method, so only the 
            New() method in INewPoint&lt;Point, T&gt; is available to be called, and the 
            C# compiler stops complaining. Also, since IPoint&lt;T&gt; implements both 
            IPointBase&lt;T&gt; and INewPoint&lt;IPoint&lt;T&gt;, T&gt;, it meets the generic
            constraints of this method and can be passed to it.
            <para/>
            Note that you don't have to write methods like Add() yourself (they are 
            provided as extension methods on IPoint.) Still, if you've read this far,
            you're probably now afraid of the effort required to write generic code! 
            Your fear may be justified. But there is another, easier way that you can 
            write generic code, based on <see cref="T:Loyc.Geometry.Point`1"/> instead of IPoint:
            <code>
            public static Point&lt;T&gt; Add&lt;T&gt;(Point&lt;T&gt; a, Point&lt;T&gt; b)
            {
            	return a+b;
            }
            </code>
            A lot easier without all those constraints, yes? The main disadvantage of 
            this version is that it doesn't have great performance, because the 
            additions are done through interface calls. A second disadvantage is that 
            you can't pass an IPoint to it. That's okay because as stated before, 
            normally the IPoint interface is not used directly!
            <para/>
            Code that uses Point&lt;T,M&gt; can run faster:
            <code>
            public static Point&lt;T,M&gt; Add&lt;T,M&gt;(Point&lt;T,M&gt; a, Point&lt;T,M&gt; b)
            {
            	return a+b;
            }
            </code>
            So, in summary, supporting fast generic code that can also operate on IPoint
            requires this odd arrangement of interfaces, and if you want to write such
            generic code then you will need three type parameters (Point, T and M) with
            the following constraints:
            <code>
                where Point : IPointBase&lt;T&gt;, INewPoint&lt;Point, T&gt;
                where M : IMath&lt;T&gt; // or another math interface
            </code>
            It may help to place your methods in a generic class (of Point, T and M) so 
            that you only have to write the constraints once.

        <member name="T:Loyc.UString">
            <summary>UString is a wrapper around string that provides a range of 21-bit 
            UCS-4 characters. "U" stands for "Unicode", as in UCS-4, as opposed to a 
            normal string that is UTF-16.</summary>
            <remarks>
            It has been suggested that Java and .NET's reliance on 16-bit "unicode" 
            characters was a mistake, because it turned out that 16 bits was not enough 
            to represent all the world's characters. And I agree.
            <para/>
            Instead it has been suggested that we should use <a href="http://www.utf8everywhere.org/">
            UTF-8 everywhere</a>. To scan UTF-8 data instead of UTF-16 while still 
            supporting non-English characters (or "ĉĥáràĉtérŝ", as I like to say),
            it is useful to have a bidirectional iterator that scans characters one
            codepoint at a time. UString provides that functionality for .NET, and
            the nice thing about UString is that it's portable to UTF-8 environments.
            That is, by using UString, your code is portable to a UTF-8 environment
            that uses an equivalent implementation of UString for UTF-8. Eventually 
            I want Loyc to target native environments, where UTF-8 is common, and 
            UString can provide a common data type for both UTF-8 and UTF-16 
            environments.
            <para/>
            UString is a bidirectional range of "uchar", which is an alias for int
            (uchar means "Unicode" or "UCS-4", rather than "unsigned").
            <para/>
            The difference between StringSlice and UString is that StringSlice is a
            random-access range of char, while UString is a bidirectional range of
            uchar (int). Since UString implements <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IListSource`1"/>,
            it requires StringSlice in order to support the Slice method.
            <para/>
            UString has a <see cref="M:Loyc.UString.DecodeAt(System.Int32)"/> method that tries to decode
            a UTF character to UCS at a particular index.
            <para/>
            Since UString and StringSlice are just slightly different views of the 
            same data, you can implicitly cast between them.
            <para/>
            Unfortunately, it's not possible for UString to compare equal to its 
            equivalent string, for two reasons: (1) System.String.Equals cannot be
            changed, and (2) UString.GetHashCode cannot return the same value as
            String.GetHashCode without actually generating a String object, which
            would be inefficient (String.GetHashCode cannot be emulated because it
            changes between versions of the .NET framework and even between 32- and 
            64-bit builds.)

            This data type helps you solve the performance problem with using "yield

            <para/>
            To illustrate how to use <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.NestedEnumerator`2"/> let's 
            consider the case of binary tree traversal. Suppose you define this data
            structure to hold a subtree of a sorted binary tree of strings:
            <code>
            internal class StringNode : IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;
            {
                internal StringNode LeftChild;
                internal string Value;
                internal StringNode RightChild;
                public IEnumerator&lt;string&gt; GetEnumerator() { ... }
            }
            </code>
            You want to write an enumerator that returns all the strings in order.
            So you write this method in the StringNode class:
            <code>
            public IEnumerator&lt;string&gt; GetEnumerator()
            {
            	foreach(string item in LeftChild)
            		yield return item;
            	yield return Value;
            	foreach(string item in RightChild)
            		yield return item;
            }
            </code>
            As explained in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3969963/when-not-to-use-yield-return">
            this web page</a>, this implementation will be slow, and it will get slower 
            and slower as the tree gets deeper.
            <para/>
            NestedEnumerator helps to solve this problem using a "virtual stack". It 
            keeps track of all the nested enumerators and always returns values from 
            the current, deepest enumerator. The enumerator objects are called "frames",
            because they are "stack frames" on the virtual stack.
            <para/>
            Each enumerator implements <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.IEnumeratorFrame`2"/> instead
            of just <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator`1"/>. A normal enumerator can only do one
            of two actions on each call to MoveNext(): it can return a T value, or stop.
            But an <c>IEnumeratorFrame</c> can do one of three things: it can return a T
            value, it can stop, or it can return a new (child) stack frame.
            <para/>
            You cannot use <c>yield return</c> with <c>NestedEnumerator</c> because it 
            is not supported by the C# compiler, so using <c>NestedEnumerator</c> 
            requires more developer effort. Here's how the GetEnumerator() method can 
            be implemented using <c>NestedEnumerator</c>:
            <code>
            public static IEnumerator&lt;string&gt; GetEnumerator()
            {
            	return new NestedEnumerator&lt;Frame, string&gt;(new Frame(this));
            }
            struct Frame : IEnumeratorFrame&lt;Frame, string&gt;
            {
                StringNode self;
                int step;
                public Frame(StringNode self) { _self = self; step = 0; }
                
                int MoveNext(ref Frame frame, ref T current)
                {
                    switch(++step) {
                        case 1: frame = new Frame(self.LeftChild);  return -1;
                        case 2: current = Value;                    return 1;
                        case 3: frame = new Frame(self.RightChild); return -1;
                    }
                    return 0;
                }
            }
            </code>
            The <c>NestedEnumerator</c> takes care of managing the stack and invoking 
            <c>MoveNext</c> on the deepest instance of <c>IEnumeratorFrame</c>.
            <para/>
            <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.IEnumeratorFrame`2"/> is an unusual interface that 
            requires <c>Frame</c> to be derived from the interface itself. The purpose 
            of this design is to allow the <c>Frame</c> data type to be a struct,
            which allows the virtual stack to consist of value types (structs), which
            improves performance because a new object does not have to be allocated on
            the heap for every stack frame. Also, if <c>Frame</c> is a struct, 
            NestedEnumerator can call <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.IEnumeratorFrame`2.MoveNext(`0@,`1@)"/>
            directly, rather than via interface dispatch, which also improves 
            performance.

            lambda function, which is unfortunate because you often want the
            original value from the list, not the number returned by the lambda.
            That's a flawed design, because often you want the original T value
            and not the projected number; if the developer actually wanted the 
            min/max <i>number</i>, he could have just used 
            <c>list.Select(lambda).Max()</c> instead of <c>list.Max(lambda)</c>.
            <para/>
            So MinOrDefault() and MaxByDefault() are different in two ways: 
            (1) they returns the original T value from the collection, and
            (2) if the collection is empty, they return a default value.

            At first, this method was a member of IListSource itself, just in

            search) or custom comparer. However, since the item to find is an "in" 
            argument, it would prevent IListSource from being marked covariant when
            I upgrade to C# 4.

            <remarks>
            In addition to standard tests (which return void), the MiniTest runner
            is planned to support [Test] methods with other return values:
            <ul>
            <li>A test can return a string, which describes the result of the test.</li>
            <li>A test can return an Action (or any other delegate that takes no 
            arguments), which is treated as a sub-test and executed. Sub-tests are 
            run without set-up or tear-down steps.</li>
            <li>A test can return an object that does not implement IEnumerable, which 
            the test runner will assume is a test fixture. The object will be scanned
            for test methods to execute.</li>
            <li>A test can return an object that implements IEnumerable, which the 
            test runner will scan to find tests and test fixtures to execute.</li>
            <li>A test can return a KeyValuePair(TKey, TValue) or DictionaryEntry.
            In that case pair's Value is processed as though it were the return value,
            and the key is a status message.</li>
            </ul>
            These features give the MiniTest runner powerful capabilities while keeping
            it simple. However, please note that NUnit doesn't offer this feature.
            <para/>
            MiniTest allows tests to be static methods if they are inside a test 
            fixture. However, when test objects are returned from a [Test] method, 
            they are not scanned for static methods.
            <para/>
            If multiple tests return the same test fixture instance, directly or 
            indirectly, MiniTest runner will avoid running the test fixture instance 
            multiple times, but it can show the results at multiple places in the 
            result tree, which can be used to construct multiple "views" of the test 
            results.  However, if a test fixture is nested within itself, the nested
            instance is excluded from the result tree.
            <para/>
            If a TestFixture class contains only a single "test suite" method (a
            method that returns tests), MiniTest merges that method with the class in 
            the tree view. For example, if the class "MyTests" has a single method 
            "GetTests", the tree view will use one line for "MyTests.GetTests" rather 
            than separating out GetTests as a child of MyTests.

            ShiftLeft and ShiftRight operations are commonly thought of as binary 
            operations, but some algorithms need to multiply numbers by powers of two 
            and want to do so efficiently, while still supporting floating-point types. 
            Therefore it makes sense to offer ShiftLeft ("multiply by a power of two")
            and ShiftRight ("divide by a power of two") operators as part of the 
            multiple/divide interface, not just <see cref="T:Loyc.Math.IBinaryMath`1"/>. Even 
            floating-point types can support these two operations efficiently by 
            directly modifying the exponent part of the floating-point representation.

            <summary>
            Localize is a global hook into which a string-mapping localizer can be
            installed. It is designed to make internationalization exceptionally easy
            for developers.
            </summary><remarks>
            All Loyc code should call this hook in order to localize text. Use it like
            this:
            <code>
            string result = Localize.From("Hello, {0}", userName);
            </code>. If you use this facility frequently in a given class, you may want
            to shorten your typing using a static variable:
            <code>
            protected static readonly FormatterDelegate L = Localize.From;
            </code>
            Then you can simply write L("Hello, {0}", userName) instead. Either way,
            whatever localizer is installed will look up the text in its database and
            return a translation. If no translation to the end user's language is
            available, an appropriate default translation should be returned: either the
            original text, or a translation to some default language, e.g. English.
            <p/>
            Alternately, assuming you have the ability to change the table of
            translations, you can use a Symbol in your code and call the other overload
            of From() to look up the text that should be shown to the end user:
            <code>
            string result = Localize.From(GSymbol.Get("MY_STRING"));
            string result = Localize.From(:MY_STRING); // Loyc syntax
            </code>
            This is most useful for long strings or paragraphs of text, but I expect
            that some projects, as a policy, will use symbols for all localizable text.
            <p/>
            Localize.Formatter() is then called to make the completed string, unless the
            variable argument list is empty. It is possible to perform formatting
            separately, for example:
            <code>
            Console.WriteLine(Localize.From("{0} is {0:X} in hexadecimal"), N);
            </code>
            Here, writeline performs the formatting instead. However, Localize's
            default formatter, Strings.Format, has an extra feature that the standard 
            formatter does not: named arguments. Here is an example:
            <code>
            ...
            string verb = Localize.From(IsFileLoaded ? "parse" : "load");
            MessageBox.Show(
                Localize.From("Not enough memory to {load/parse} '{filename}'."
                  {Message}", "load/parse", verb, "filename", FileName));
            }
            </code>
            As you can see, named arguments are mentioned in the format string by
            specifying an argument name such as {filename} instead of a number like
            {0}. The variable argument list contains the same name followed by its
            value, e.g. "filename", FileName. This feature gives you, the developer,
            the opportunity to indicate to the translator person what a particular 
            argument is for.
            <p/>
            The translator must not change any of the arguments: the word "{filename}"
            is not to be translated.
            <p/>
            At run-time, the format string with named arguments is converted to a
            "normal" format string with numbered arguments. The above example would
            become "Could not {1} the file: {3}" and then be passed to string.Format.
            
            <h3>Design rationale</h3>
            Many developers don't want to spend time writing internationalization or
            localization code, and are tempted to write code that is only for one
            language. It's no wonder, because it's a relative pain in the neck.
            Microsoft suggests that code carry around a "ResourceManager" object and
            directly request strings from it:
            <code>
            private ResourceManager rm;
            rm = new ResourceManager("MyStrings", this.GetType().Assembly);
            Console.Writeline(rm.GetString("HEXER"), N);
            </code>
            This approach has drawbacks:
            * It may be cumbersome to pass around a ResourceManager instance between all
              classes that might contain localizable strings; a global facility is
              much more convenient.
            * The programmer has to put all translations in the resource file;
              consequently, writing the code is bothersome because the programmer has
              to switch to the resource file and add the string to it. Someone reading
              the code, in turn, can't tell what the string says and has to load up
              the resource file to find out.
            * It is nontrivial to change the localization manager; for instance, what if
              someone wants to store translations in an .ini or .xml file rather than
              inside the assembly? What if the user wants to centralize all
              translations for a set of assemblies, rather than having separate
              resources in each assembly?
            * Keeping in mind that the guy in charge of translation is typically
              different than the guys writing most of the code, it makes sense to keep
              translations separate from everything else.
            <p/>
            The idea of the Localize facility is to convince programmers to support
            localization by making it dead-easy to do. By default it is not connected to
            any translator (it just passes strings through), so people who are only
            writing a program for a one-language market can easily make their code
            "multiligual-ready" without doing any extra work, since Localize.From() is
            no harder to type than String.Format().
            <p/>
            The translation system itself is separate, and connected to Localize by a
            delegate, for two reasons:
            <ol>
            <li>Multiple translation systems are possible. This class should be suitable
                for any .NET program, and some programs using this utility will want to
                plug-in a different localizer. </li>
            <li>I personally don't have the time or expertise to write a localizer at 
                this time. So until I do, the Localize class will make my code ready for 
                translation, although not actually localized.</li>
            </ol>
            In the open source world, most developers don't have a team of translators
            ready make translations for them. The idea of Loyc, for example, is that
            many different individuals--not one big team--of programmers will create
            and maintain features. By centralizing this translation facility, it should
            be straightforward for a single multilingual individual to translate the
            text of many Loyc extensions made by many different people.
            <p/>
            To facilitate this, I propose that in addition to a translator, a Loyc
            extension should be made to figure out all the strings/symbols for which
            translations are needed. To do this it would scan source code (at compile
            time) for calls to methods in this class and generate a list of strings and
            symbols needing translation. It would also have to detect certain calls that
            perform translation implicity, such as ISimpleMessageSink.Write(). See
            <see cref="T:Loyc.LocalizableAttribute"/>.

            <para/>
            X1 and Y1 should contains the minimum coordinates, while X2 and Y2 
            should contain the maximum coordinates. BoundingBox generally does not 
            guarantee that this is true unless you call <see cref="M:Loyc.Geometry.BoundingBoxExt.Normalize``1(Loyc.Geometry.BoundingBox{``0})"/>,
            or if you use a constructor that accepts two points (rather than 
            explicit minimum and maximum coordinates.) Some methods will not work
            correctly if the "maximum" coordinate is less than the "minimum" 
            coordinate; they may simply assume that the maximum exceeds the 
            minumum.
            <para/>
            A BoundingBox is considered to include both the minimum and maximum 
            coordinates. A point on the border is considered to be within the 
            bounding box, and the Width and Height are incremented to account
            for this. For example, if T is int and (X1,X2)=(0,10), the Width is
            11; if T is float and (X1,X2)=(0,10), the Width is infitessimally
            more than 10 (the result is incremented with MathEx.NextHigher()).

             choosing that implement the specified Interface, forwarding calls to 
             methods in the wrapped object. It is inspired by the duck-typed interfaces 
             in the Go programming language.</summary>
             <remarks>
             In the Go programming language, you do not say explicitly that your type 
             implements a given interface. Instead, a type is convertable to <i>any</i>
             interface, just so long as it implements all the methods in the interface.
             This often reminds people of "duck typing" in dynamic languages such as 
             Python or Ruby, but it is faster; in fact, Go interface calls are the same 
             speed as virtual method calls in C++ and C#!
             <para/>
             To put it in C# terms, if you have a class T...
             <pre>public class T {
                 public void Foo(int x);
             }</pre>
             
             ...and an interface called "Interface"...
             
             <pre>public interface Interface {
                 void Foo(int x);
             }</pre>
            
             ...then you can cast T to Interface even though T does not explicitly implement it.
            
             <pre>Interface t = new T();</pre>
             
             This cast can be implicit since the compiler can tell at compile time that
             T implements the Interface. However, you can cast any object to Interface 
             and, at run-time, Go will determine whether it implements the Interface.
             <para/>
             I asked how Go dispatch works on the "Go Nuts" google group and was pointed 
             to two articles:
             <para/>
             http://research.swtch.com/2009/12/go-data-structures-interfaces.html
             http://www.airs.com/blog/archives/281
             <para/>
             To summarize those, the first time you convert a type "T" to an interface 
             "Interface", a vtable (virtual function table) is generated just like the 
             kind used for virtual calls in .NET and C++. However, instead of storing 
             the vtable in the object itself like C++ and .NET do, Go stores the vtable 
             pointer alongside the interface pointer (i.e. an interface pointer is 
             really two pointers). This simple but unique design allows a single object
             to implement an unlimited number of interfaces with overall performance 
             that is competitive with C# and Java.
             <para/>
             Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, there is no way to efficiently
             implement this same technique in .NET without changing the CLR itself. A
             virtual method table is just a list of pointers to functions; importantly,
             function pointers in a virtual method table are not associated with a
             specific object, which makes them different from .NET delegates. By not
             associating the vtable with a specific object, it is possible to re-use the
             same vtable with any number of objects (as long as they are of the same
             class). However, .NET delegates are associated with specific objects, so we
             can't use them to form a reusable vtable.
             <para/>
             Even if .NET allowed delegates that are not associated with a specific
             object, delegate invocation on .NET is slower than virtual method
             invocation; why this is so is not entirely clear to me, but part of the
             reason may be that Microsoft decided to make delegates reference types when
             they should have been a simpler 8-byte value type (just bundling a function
             pointer with a 'this' pointer).
             <para/>
             However, just a few days ago I learned that Visual Basic 9 has a very
             similar feature to Go called "dynamic interfaces", which pretty much lets
             you do as described above (albeit only in Visual Basic). So far I've heard
             nothing about how VB's dynamic interfaces work, but I got to thinking: how
             hard would it be to bring go-style interfaces to all .NET languages, and
             would it be possible to get good performance?
             <para/>
             The technique I chose doesn't have performance as good as you would get from
             Go, but in exchange for a small performance hit (which I believe to be
             unavoidable anyway), the GoInterface classes provide automatic interface
             adaptations that you can't get in Go itself. Specifically, my GoInterface
             classes can automatically do small type conversion tasks like enlarging
             "int" to "long", boxing value types, and allowing return type covariance
             (for instance, if the wrapped method returns a "string", the Interface can
             return an "object".) And since GoInterface returns heap objects that
             actually implement the interface you ask for (rather than, say, an 8-byte
             structure imitating the Go implementation), it's very easy to use.
             <para/>
             The GoInterface classes use .NET Reflection.Emit to generate wrapper classes
             in a "dynamic assembly"--basically a DLL that exists only in memory. Each
             wrapper class implements a single interface of your choosing, and forwards
             calls on that interface to an object of your choosing.
             <para/>
             Given the types from above...
             
             <pre>public class T {
                 public void Foo(int x);
             }
             public interface Interface {
                 void Foo(int x);
             }</pre>
             
             ...you can use GoInterface to cast T to Interface like this:
             
             <pre>Interface t = GoInterface&lt;Interface>.From(new T());</pre>
             
             The first time you cast a T to Interface, GoInterface generates a wrapper 
             class such as the following on-the-fly:
             
             <pre>public class T_46F3E18_46102A0 : Interface
             {
                 T _obj;
                 public T_46F3E18_46102A0(T obj) { _obj = obj; }
                 void Foo(int x) { _obj.Foo(x); }
             }</pre>
             
             The hex numbers in the name of the type are simply handles to interface and 
             type being wrapped, in order to guarantee no name collisions occur when you 
             are wrapping a lot of different classes with GoInterface.
             <para/>
             After the first cast, all future casts are fairly fast, especially if you
             call GoInterface&lt;Interface,T>.From() instead of just
             GoInterface&lt;Interface>.From(). That's because after
             GoInterface&lt;Interface,T> is fully initialized, all its From() method does
             is invoke a delegate that contains the following code:
             
             <pre>delegate(T obj) { return new T_46F3E18_46102A0(obj); }</pre>
             
             You can create wrappers with either GoInterface&lt;Interface> or
             GoInterface&lt;Interface, T> (note the extra type argument "T").
             <ul>
             <li>GoInterface&lt;Interface> is intended for creating wrappers when you do
             not know the type of the object at compile time. For example, if you have a
             list of objects of unknown type and you want to cast them to an interface,
             use this one.</li>
             <li>GoInterface&lt;Interface, T> creates wrappers when you already know the
             type of the object at compile time. This version assumes that T itself (and
             not some derived class!) contains the methods you want to call.
             GoInterface&lt;Interface, T> has the disadvantage that it is unable to call
             methods in a derived class of T. For example, you should not use
             GoInterface&lt;Interface, object> because the object class does not contain
             a Foo method.</li>
             </ul>
             If you're not sure which one to use, use GoInterface&lt;Interface>. If you
             need to adapt a large number of objects to a single interface, you should
             use GoInterface&lt;Interface, T> where possible, because it is slightly
             faster. GoInterface&lt;Interface>, in contrast, has to examine each object
             it is given to find out its most derived type. However, this process is
             optimized so that an expensive analysis is only done once per derived type,
             after which only a hashtable lookup is required.
             <para/>
             Compared to interfaces in the Go programming language, which have a 1-word
             overhead for every interface pointer (the vtable pointer, which is 4 bytes
             in 32-bit code), GoInterface wrappers normally have 3 words of overhead (2
             words for the wrapper's object header and 1 word for a reference to the
             wrapped object). Also, GoInterface wrapper classes are no doubt much more
             costly to produce (since they involve run-time code generation), which will
             increase your program's startup time and have a fixed memory overhead that
             dwarfs Go's implementation. However, once you are up-and-running with
             GoInterface wrappers, their performance should be pretty good. TODO:
             benchmarks
             <para/>
             Note: GoInterface can create wrappers for value types (structures), not just
             classes. Such wrappers have the same memory overhead as boxed structures,
             which is one word less than wrappers for reference types.
             <para/>
             GoInterface wrappers automatically forward calls to object.ToString(),
             object.GetHashCode() and object.Equals(), even though these methods are 
             not technically part of the interface being wrapped.
             <para/>
             GoInterface cannot wrap explicit interface implementations in the target
             class. For instance, if the target class implements IEnumerable(of T), that
             interface has two versions of the GetEnumerator function that differ only by
             return type (one returns IEnumerator and the other returns IEnumerator(of
             T)), so one of them must be implemented "explicitly". GoInterface will
             typically only see the version that returns IEnumerator(of T), but this is
             not a problem since IEnumerator(of T) is implicitly convertable to
             IEnumerator, so GoInterface can use that one method to represent either of 
             them. In Visual Basic there is a caveat, since an explicit interface
             implementation is allowed to be public. In that case, GoInterface will only 
             see the method's public name (not the name used in the interface).

            Before generating code for the method, we must find a matching

            <para/>
            - Return type covariance. If T's method returns a derived class,
              Interface's method can return a base class or interface. Also, 
              allow any return type if baseMethod returns void.
            - "out" parameter covariance.
            - T's "out" argument(s) can be absent from Interface, as long as
              they are at the end of the argument list.
            - Interface's input arguments can be absent from T, as long as the

            Methods that differ only in case are not considered, but Aliases 
            specified with GoAliasAttribute are considered if a matching method 
            with the original name could not be found. All matching aliases are 
            considered together, as if they were overloads of each other.
            <para/>
            We scan all methods of "T" with a matching name and find the best
            match, since there may be multiple methods matching these
            requirements. For the most part I try to follow the rules of 
            the C# standard (ECMA-334 §14.4.2.1 and §14.4.2.2), but be a little 
            more liberal. The way I figure it, "void" should be treated like a
            base class of "object". Note that this matching algorithm may reject
            all overloads due to "ambiguity", in case one overload is not better
            than all others.

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            After writing the basic functionality of GoInterface, I realized it could
            also serve as a handy way to implement the Decorator pattern. A decorator
            is a class that wraps around some target class (usually sharing the same
            interface or base class), while modifying the functionality of the target.
            For instance, you could write a decorator for TextWriter that filters out 
            curse words, replacing them with asterisks.
            <para/>
            Writing decorators is sometimes inconvenient because you only want to 
            modify the behavior of some functions while leaving others alone. 
            Without GoInterface, you must write a wrapper for every method, manually 
            forwarding calls from the decorator to the target.
            <para/>
            GoInterface can help by generating forwarding functions automatically.
            <para/>
            The example shows how to use GoInterface to help you make a decorator.

            A fast, tiny 4-byte lock to support multiple readers or a single writer.
            Designed for low-contention, high-performance scenarios where reading is 
            common and writing is rare.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Do not use the default constructor! Use TinyReaderWriterLock.New as the
            initial value of the lock.
            <para/>
            Recursive locking is not supported: the same lock cannot be acquired twice 
            for writing on the same thread, nor can a reader lock be acquired after 
            the writer lock was acquired on the same thread. If you make either of 
            these mistakes, the lock will throw an NotSupportedException.
            <para/>
            You also cannot acquire a read lock followed recursively by a write lock,
            either. Attempting to do so will self-deadlock the thread, bacause 
            TinyReaderWriterLock does not track the identity of each reader and is not
            aware that it is waiting for the current thread to finish reading.
            <para/>
            However, multiple reader locks can be acquired on the same thread, just as
            multiple reader locks can be acquired by different threads.
            <para/>
            Make sure you call ExitRead() or ExitWrite() in a finally block! When 
            compiled in debug mode, TinyReaderWriterLock will make sure you don't mix
            up ExitRead() and ExitWrite().

            The range of Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId is undocumented. I have
            assumed they don't use IDs close to int.MinValue, so I use values near
            int.MinValue to indicate the number of readers holding the lock.

            <remarks>
            This class exists to solve two problems. First, the [ThreadStatic] 
            attribute is not supported in the .NET Compact Framework. Second, and
            more importantly, .NET does not propagate thread-local variables when 
            creating new threads, which is a huge problem if you want to implement
            the <a href="http://loyc-etc.blogspot.com/2010/08/pervasive-services-and-di.html">
            Ambient Service Pattern</a>. This class copies the T value from a parent
            thread to a child thread, but because .NET provides no way to hook into
            thread creation, it only works if you use <see cref="T:Loyc.Threading.ThreadEx"/> instead 
            of standard threads.
            <para/>
            ThreadLocalVariable implements thread-local variables using a dictionary 
            that maps thread IDs to values.
            <para/>
            Variables of this type are typically static and they must NOT be marked
            with the [ThreadStatic] attribute.
            <para/>
            ThreadLocalVariable(of T) is less convenient than the [ThreadStatic]
            attribute, but ThreadLocalVariable works with ThreadEx to propagate the 
            value of the variable from parent threads to child threads, and you can
            install a propagator function to customize the way the variable is 
            copied (e.g. in case you need a deep copy).
            <para/>
            Despite my optimizations, ThreadLocalVariable is just over half as fast 
            as a ThreadStatic variable in CLR 2.0, in a test with no thread 
            contention. Access to the dictionary accounts for almost half of the 
            execution time; try-finally (needed in case of asyncronous exceptions) 
            blocks use up 11%; calling Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId takes 
            about 9%; and the rest, I presume, is used up by the TinyReaderWriterLock.

             <remarks>
             ScratchBuffer is typically used as a static variable to hold a temporary
             object used for operations that are done frequently and require a 
             temporary memory space--but only during the operation, not afterward.
             <para/>
             For example, CPTrie may require a temporary byte array during searches.
             Re-creating the byte array for every search might cause a too much time
             to be spent garbage-collecting. On the other hand, if CPTrie keeps a 
             reference to the temporary buffer in itself, what if a program contains 
             many instances of CPTrie? Each one would have its own separate temporary
             buffer, wasting memory. The buffer can't be a straightforward global
             variable, either, in case two threads need a scratch buffer at once.
             ScratchBuffer, then, exists to prevent two threads from using the same 
             buffer.
             <para/>
             ScratchBuffer is designed with the assumption that creating a scratch
             buffer is fast, but re-using an existing buffer is faster. Since 
             creating a scratch buffer is cheap already, this class is worthless 
             unless it is even cheaper. Therefore, it does not hold a buffer for 
             each thread, since managing multiple buffers would be too expensive; 
             and volatile variable access is used instead of locking.
             <para/>
             ScratchBuffer originally returned null if the scratch buffer had not 
             been initialized or was associated with a different thread, requiring
             the caller to create a new buffer manually. Now there is a new constructor 
             that takes a factory function, which is called automatically by the Value
             property if the scratch buffer is null or belongs to another thread. If
             you use this constructor, then you do longer have to worry about Value 
             returning null.
             <example>
             static ScratchBuffer&lt;byte[]&gt; _buf = 
                new ScratchBuffer&lt;byte[]&gt;(() => new byte[40]);
            
             // A method called a million times that needs a scratch buffer each time
             void FrequentOperation()
             {
            		byte[] buf = _buf.Value;
                 
                 // do something here involving the buffer ...
             }
             </example>
             Arguably it is better to use a [ThreadStatic] variable is instead of 
             ScratchBuffer, but FWIW [ThreadStatic] is not available on the .NET
             Compact Framework.

            This formatter works like string.Format, except that named 
            placeholders accepted as well as numeric placeholders. This method
            replaces named placeholders with numbers, then calls string.Format.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Named placeholders are useful for communicating information about a
            placeholder to a human translator. Here is an example:
            <code>
            Not enough memory to {load/parse} '{filename}'.
            </code>
            In some cases a translator might have difficulty translating a phrase
            without knowing what a numeric placeholder ({0} or {1}) refers to, so 
            a named placeholder can provide an important clue. The localization  
            system is invoked as follows:
            <code>
            string msg = Localize.From("{man's name} meets {woman's name}.",
            	"man's name", mansName, "woman's name", womansName);
            </code>
            The placeholder names are not case sensitive.
            
            You can use numeric placeholders, alignment and formatting codes also:
            <code>
            string msg = Localize.From("You need to run {km,6:###.00} km to reach {0}",
            	cityName, "KM", 2.9);
            </code>
            This method will ignore the first N+1 arguments in args, where {N}
            is the largest numeric placeholder. It is assumed that the placeholder 
            name ends at the first comma or colon; hence the placeholder in this 
            example is called "km", not "km,6:###.00".
            
            If a placeholder name is not found in the argument list then it is not
            replaced with a number before the call to string.Format, so a 
            FormatException will occur.

            <remarks>
            EzStopwatch is a wrapper around the normal <see cref="T:System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch"/> that
            is less clumsy to use: you can get the elapsed time and restart the 
            timer from zero with a single call to Restart(). The Stopwatch class
            (prior to .NET 4, anyway) requires you to make three separate method 
            calls to do the same thing: you have to call ElapsedMilliseconds, then 
            Reset(), then Start().
            <para/>
            Unlike <see cref="T:Loyc.SimpleTimer"/>, this class does not start timing when
            it is created, which allows it to be a struct without a constructor.
            <para/>
            EzStopwatch behaves differently from Stopwatch when restarting, because I
            observed a problem using the timer to measure short time intervals. I ran
            trials of three operations in a loop, and the loop was programmed to run 
            until the total elapsed time for one of the operations exceeded 100 ms. On 
            each iteration I restarted the timer three times because there were three 
            operations to measure, and when I replaced <see cref="T:Loyc.SimpleTimer"/> with 
            <see cref="T:Loyc.EzStopwatch"/> for greater accuracy, the loop ran forever! The
            problem was that (depending on the benchmark's input parameters) the 
            operation could take less than 1 millisecond to complete, so 
            <see cref="P:Loyc.EzStopwatch.Millisec"/> always returned zero, and the total never reached
            100.
            <para/>
            To solve this problem, when you "<see cref="M:Loyc.EzStopwatch.Restart"/>" the timer, it is
            not completely reset to zero, but rather the current value of Millisec is
            subtracted from the timer. This leaves a fractional amount of time less
            than 1 millisecond in the timer, so that if you take two measurements 
            that each take 0.6 milliseconds, Millisec will return 0 the first time
            and 1 the second time, leaving 0.2 milliseconds on the clock.
            <para/>
            TODO: change interfaces of SimpleTimer and EzStopwatch to better resemble
            Stopwatch, even though the behavior of "Pause" and "Resume" is more obvious

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            With SimpleTimer, the timer starts when you construct the object and

            timer from zero with a single call to Restart(). The Stopwatch class 
            requires you to make three separate method calls to do the same thing:
            you have to call ElapsedMilliseconds, then Reset(), then Start().

            SimpleTimer cannot be used to measure time periods longer than 24.8 
            days. The 32-bit millisecond counter will overflow and Millisec will

            </summary>
            <remarks>
            This type is implemented with what is commonly called a "circular buffer".
            There is a single array plus a "start index" and a count. The array may or 
            may not be divided into two "halves", depending on the circumstances.
            The first element of the DList (returned from this[0] and from the
            First property) is located at the start index of the array; and if the 
            index + count is greater than the array size, then the end of the DList
            wraps around to the beginning of the array.
            <para/>
            InternalDeque is a struct, not a class, in order to save memory; and for 
            maximum performance, it asserts rather than throwing an exception 
            when an incorrect array index is used (the one exception is the iterator,
            which throws in case the collection is modified during enumeration; this 
            is for the sake of <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.DList`1"/>.) For these and other reasons, one
            should not expose it in a public API, and it should only be used when 
            performance trumps all other concerns.
            <para/>
            Also, do not use the default contructor. Always specify an initial 
            capacity or copy InternalDeque.Empty so that the internal array gets a 
            value. All methods in this structure assume _array is not null.
            <para/>
            This class does not implement <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.IDeque`1"/> and <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IList`1"/> in order to help you not to shoot yourself in the foot.
            The problem is that any extension methods used with those interfaces that 
            change the list, such as PopLast(), malfunction because the structure is
            implicitly boxed, producing a shallow copy. By not implementing those 
            interfaces, the extension methods are not available, ensuring you don't
            accidently box the structure. You can always call <see cref="M:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalDList`1.AsDList"/> 
            to construct a <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.DList`1"/> in O(1) time, if you need those 
            interfaces.
            <para/>
            You may be curious why <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalList`1"/>, in contrast, DOES
            implement <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IList`1"/>. It's because there is no way to make
            <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.List`1"/> from <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalList`1"/> in O(1) time;
            so boxing the <see cref="T:Loyc.Collections.Impl.InternalList`1"/> is the only fast way to get
            an instance of <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IList`1"/>.
